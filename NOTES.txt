PRINT 2 trace:
L0acf (PRINT)
L0afa (NOT-AT)
L0b31 (NOT-TAB)
L0F55 (SCANNING)
L0018 RST 18 (GET-CH) loads a with 1E ("2")
L0F59 S-RND
L0F8c S-PI
L0f9d S-INKEY$
L0fb2 S-ALPHNUM

L14d9 DEC-TO-FP
L1548 INT-TO-FP
L0028 RST 28 FP-CALC
L19a8 CALCULATE
L1B85 STK-PNTRS
Everything seems OK up to the JP P, 19C2 line.  (L19bb)

June 1, 2013
Dedicated effort to solve the 2E-8 problem.
Sift through the PRINT command to find the problem.
Follow the complete ROM Dissammbly PDF for better descriptions of the routines.
Currently at the "SCANNING" routine (L0b31).

May 29, 2013
Filled in another opcode.
Still many issues.
Slowness. 
Last line doesn't display correctly after executing something.
Displays 2E-8 for the integer 2.

May 29, 2013
Filling in more opcodes.

May 28, 2013
Filling in opcodes getting LET A=2 statement to work.

May 27, 2013
Still attempting to debug why 'PRINT 2' prints 2E-8.
L1595 routine may be mistranslating a number?
The variable assignment LET A=2 results in an unimplemented opcode, if I can't 
solve the above bug I might move on to that problem.

Attempting to debug why 'PRINT 2' prints 2E-8
The PRINT command is executed at L0ACF

The redraw issues after executing a command may be related to timing issues.  Need to review all
the opcodes executed after that for timing accuracy.

Need to seriously consider reworking the flow so that the tick() fn is called much, much less.

Brainstorming:
Can I read everything needed to execute an opcode at once?  And execute a "multi-tick" after...
Can the 'glutIdle' function perform more work per call?


May 20, 2013 
I think I need to explicitly clear the screen at each vertical retrace.
Need to update the tick() flow, so that the tick() callback takes a number of
cycles to execute argument.  The spinning can be optimized a little in the
callback.

Added the DAA opcode.  It needs to be verified.

May 17, 2013

Implemented a few more opcodes.

Screen doesn't display correctly.  Probably a bug in the TV module.

Examining the memory, it seems it's writing 0 at the top of the screen, when
the addition should produce 4.

Also, the 0 doesn't draw at the top of the TV (more in the middle) again,
probably a bug in the TV Module.

May 16, 2013

Implemented many more missing opcodes.

The PRINT 2+2 operation runs to completion.  However the output doesn't 
appear in the correctd place on the screen.

May 15, 2013

Bug was related to using logical and (&&) instead of bitwise and (&) in a
couple of places.

May 14, 2013

L-MODE is set on L0556.
Figure out what happends between the last L0927 and the next NOP.
The current op file contains the PRINT keyword.  The cursor should change
to L after this keyword.
L-mode gets set after PRINT - look to see where the cursor routine is 
called again to see what goes wrong.


May 13, 2013

L04d4 is where LAST_K is loaded into BC

May 12, 2013

At line L095d all the characters have been printed (I think).
Why is WRITE-N/L at L0847 being called?

May 11, 2013

At last instance of L0a46 0 is loaded into HL from 4039.  This seems to be 
a problem.

May 9, 2013

No progress on the bug.
Start tracing forward from the last K-DECODE routine call (L04df).

May 8, 2013
Better keyboard support.
Supports shift keys and continuous typing.
Still doesn't work before you type before the cursor displays.
There is a bug where it attempts to read non existent memeory

May 7, 2013

I think the keyboard doesn't get stuck anymore. 
I don't think the buffering is working waiting during the 'debounce' though.

Not bothering with speed as of now.
It seems I can get 12MHz max from perl in a simple no-op loop.  
Performance drops significantly when functions are called.

I need 3.25MHz for this, but it currently runs at 80KHz.

I'll look at it later.

May 6, 2013

Better keyboard reading.  Still seems to lose keystrokes if you try and 
type too fast.

Runs extremely slowly.

Implemented several more missing opcodes.  Keywords now appear.

May 5, 2013

Fixed bug in the calculate_add_flags routine - it was not setting the Z flag correctly.

Need to figure out why the second key press is not being recognized.

May 5, 2013

The key lookup at L0515 is not correct.  
A should be indexing into the K-UNSHIFT values
