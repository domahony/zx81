No progress on the bug.
Start tracing forward from the last K-DECODE routine call (L04df).

Better keyboard support.
Supports shift keys and continuous typing.
Still doesn't work before you type before the cursor displays.
There is a bug where it attempts to read non existent memeory

I think the keyboard doesn't get stuck anymore. 
I don't think the buffering is working waiting during the 'debounce' though.

Not bothering with speed as of now.
It seems I can get 12MHz max from perl in a simple no-op loop.  
Performance drops significantly when functions are called.

I need 3.25MHz for this, but it currently runs at 80KHz.

I'll look at it later.

Better keyboard reading.  Still seems to lose keystrokes if you try and 
type too fast.

Runs extremely slowly.

Implemented several more missing opcodes.  Keywords now appear.

Fixed bug in the calculate_add_flags routine - it was not setting the Z flag correctly.

Need to figure out why the second key press is not being recognized.

The key lookup at L0515 is not correct.  
A should be indexing into the K-UNSHIFT values
