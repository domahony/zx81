____ ZX80 vs ZX81 Compatibility ____<br>
<br>
<b>Hardware</b><br>
The ZX80 and ZX81 hardware is mostly the same, the same I/O address are used,
RAM is located at 4000h and up, and mirrored as VRAM at C000h and up. The
only relevant physical difference is that ZX81 includes an NMI generator,
which is (optionally) allowing to execute programs during vertical blanking
periods.<br>
<br>
<b>Firmware</b><br>
Compatibility ends at the firmware side, the revised ZX81 BIOS version
dropped any compatibility issues. The content of cassette files is different,
some characters in the character set have been exchanged, the system area is
different, the BASIC interpreter 'opcodes' have different meanings, variables
and immediates are stored as floating point numbers (ZX81) instead as
integers (ZX80), and any addresses in the BIOS ROM are different also.<br>
<br>
<b>Software</b><br>
As described above, ZX80 and ZX81 cassette files are completely incompatible
to each other. However, the ZX81 BASIC syntax is mostly compatible to ZX80
syntax, so that ZX80 software could be easily imported to ZX81 with little
changes; either by translation program that adjusts the file content, or by
manually entering the source code.<br>
<br>
<b>Performance</b><br>
The main advantage of ZX81 hardware is the ability to execute program code
and to display a picture simultaneously in SLOW mode. As the name says, this
fancy feature is heavily slowing down effective CPU speed.<br>
Otherwise ZX81 should be theoretically as fast as the trusty ZX80,
unfortunately the new BASIC interpreter uses floating point values rather
than integers, and thus ZX81 BASIC programs are ways slower even when using
FAST mode.<br>
<br>
<b>TS1500 BIOS</b><br>
The inefficient RAM size detection function is removed, instead, the BIOS
uses a hardcoded RAM size of 16K, additionally it checks for "TS1510 Command
Cartridge Player" ROMs at location 2000h, and starts them if present (the
first opcode byte at 2000h must be 01h, ie. "ld bc,nnnn").<br>
The TS1500 BIOS does fix the LPRINT bug, and it does (attempt) to increase
floating point conversion accurracy (the ZX81/TS1000 tends to round-down
values by accident, whilst the TS1500 tends to round-up values by accident,
which isn't any better, and in some cases it's even worse).<br>
<br>
____ Sinclair ZX81 Personal Computer ____<br>
<br>
<b>Multimedia</b><br>
The first step to modern decadency was done by releasing the ZX81, this
computer had the ability to operate in a so called SLOW mode, during
which it could both execute a program AND display a picture on the
screen at the SAME time, while its predecessor the ZX80 could do only
either one at once. This older computer has been restricted to FAST
mode, offering high performance execution time.<br>
<br>
<b>Energy</b><br>
Anyways, a very amazing thing's been the keyboard heating. Even though
the computer's been operated at 5 Volts, it's been delivered with
external 9V power supply. The cooling plate of the 7805 voltage
regulator's been located directly under the keyboard, whereas cooling
plate is a possibly misleading expression, it's been heating up after a
while, giving the keyboard an irritating feverish temparature. If
somebody'd claim that ZX81 are tough guys and that they'd never get cold
fingers - I could only confirm that.<br>
<br>
<b>Computers Today</b><br>
Unfortunately, the rather ineffective new invention of animated pictures
has been adapted by newer computers, up to today!<br>
As far as concerning power supplies, this has been another milestone in
home computer technology, and there's still nobody who stands up, takes
his ventilated heavy 200 Watts supply, and smashes it into the face of
the guy who has mass-manufactured it.<br>

<table width="100%"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#cccccc"><td><a name="zx80zx81videomodetextandblockgraphics"></a><font size="+2">&nbsp;ZX80/ZX81 Video Mode Text and Blockgraphics</font></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
<b>Overview</b><br>
This is the ZX standard video mode. The display area consists of 32x24
characters of 8x8 pixels each. The user cannot set single pixels though,
only 64 predefined characters can be used. However, some of these
characters are split into 2x2 blocks (4x4 pixel each), allowing to
display 64x48 block low resolution graphics.<br>
<br>
<b>Video Memory</b><br>
Video memory is addressed by the D_FILE pointer (400Ch) in ZX80/81
system area. The first byte in VRAM is a HALT opcode (76h), followed by
the data (one byte per character) for each of the 24 lines, each line is
terminated by a HALT opcode also. In case that a line contains less than
32 characters, the HALT opcode blanks (white) the rest of the line up to
the right screen border. (Thus left-aligned text will take up less
memory than centered or right-aligned text.)<br>
<br>
<b>Character Data, VRAM Size</b><br>
Character data in range 00h..3Fh displays the 64 characters, normally
black on white. Characters may be inverted by setting Bit 7, ie.
C0h..FFh represents the same as above displayed white on black.<br>
The fully expanded VRAM size is 793 bytes (32x24 + 25 HALTs, almost
occupying the whole 1Kbyte of internal RAM), an empty fully collapsed
screen occupies only 25 bytes (HALTs).<br>
<br>
<b>Character Set</b><br>
The character set is addressed by the I register multiplied by 100h. In
the ZX81 this is 1Eh for 1E00h..1FFFh, in ZX80 0Eh for 0E00h..0FFFh.
Setting I=40h..7Fh in attempt to define a custom charset in RAM rather
than ROM does not work.<br>
<br>
<b>Display procedure Tech Details</b><br>
The display data is more or less 'executed' by the CPU. When displaying
a line, the BIOS takes the address of the first character, eg. 4123h,
sets Bit 15, ie. C123h, and then jumps to that address.<br>
<br>
The hardware now senses A15=HIGH and /M1=LOW (signalizing opcode read),
upon this condition memory is mirrored from C000-FFFF to 4000-7FFF. The
'opcode' is presented to the databus as usually, the display circuit
interpretes it as character data, and (if Bit 6 is zero) forces the
databus to zero before the CPU realizes what is going on, causing a NOP
opcode (00h) to be executed. Bit 7 of the stolen opcode is used as
invert attribute, Bit 0-5 address one of the 64 characters in ROM at
(I*100h+char*8+linecntr), the byte at that address is loaded into a
shift register, and bits are shifted to the display at a rate of 6.5MHz
(ie. 8 pixels within 4 CPU cycles).<br>
<br>
However, when encountering an opcode with Bit 6 set, then the video
circuit rejects the opcode (displays white, regardless of Bit 7 and
0-5), and the CPU executes the opcode as normal. Usually this would be
the HALT opcode - before displaying a line, BIOS enables INTs and
initializes the R register, which will produce an interrupt when Bit 6
of R becomes zero.<br>
In this special case R is incremented at a fixed rate of 4 CPU cycles
(video data executed as NOPs, followed by repeated HALT), so that line
display is suspended at a fixed time, regardless of the collapsed or
expanded length of the line.<br>
<br>
As mentioned above, an additional register called linecntr is used to
address the vertical position (0..7) whithin a character line. This
register is reset during vertical retrace, and then incremented once per
scanline. The BIOS thus needs to 'execute' each character line eight
times, before starting to 'execute' the next character line.<br>
<br>
<br>
<table width="100%"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#cccccc"><td><a name="zx80zx81videomodepseudohiresgraphics"></a><font size="+2">&nbsp;ZX80/ZX81 Video Mode Pseudo Hi-Res Graphics</font></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
This method is used to display 256x192 pixels graphics, limited to max
128 combinations within each row of 8 pixels though. Even though not
supported by the BIOS, a couple of games are using this video mode: Rock
Crush, Dans Revenge, Rocketman, Forty Niner, Madjump II, Bipods,
Micromouse, and possibly others.<br>
<br>
Basically it is working much like Text video mode, the character height
is reduced to a single scanline, so each tile consists of 8x1 pixels
rather than 8x8 pixels. And the screen consists of 32x192 of these
'flat' characters, each line usually terminated by a RET opcode (C9h),
thus occupying 6176 bytes of memory.<br>
<br>
A special display procedure is required which forces the linecntr
register to zero by issuing a very short 'vertical retrace' signal each
scanline (preferably simultaneously to the hardware generated horizontal
retrace signal). In result, only the topmost row of each character will
be displayed, as the topmost row of most of the normal characters is
just blank, it'd be recommended to change the characterset pointer in
the I register to another address in ROM.<br>
<br>
For example, setting I=0Ch would select the area 0C00h..0DFFh (in steps
of eight: topmost rows of chars #0, #1, #2 at C00h, C08h, C10h, etc).
The machine code bytes in this memory region are then used as 'randomly'
predefined pixel rows, which may or may not match the programmers
requirements. Each of the 64 rows may be inverted as normal text
characters, so theoretical a total of 128 different 8-pixel rows can be
used, practically less because most likely a couple of rows will be
duplicated.<br>
<br>
As the interrupt based BIOS display procedure at 0038h does not support
above, a raw software based handler is used in most cases, that's why each
line is terminated by a RET rather than HALT opcode.<br>
<br>
Observe that the TS1500 BIOS version contains some patched opcodes, so
graphics may appear different as with original ZX81/TS1000 BIOS (the most
commonly used region, with I=0Ch, is same in both BIOS versions).<br>
<br>
<br>
<table width="100%"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#cccccc"><td><a name="zx80zx81videomodetruehiresgraphics"></a><font size="+2">&nbsp;ZX80/ZX81 Video Mode True Hi-Res Graphics</font></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
This mode produces a 256x192 pix graphics screen, and, unlike Pseudo
Hi-Res, it allows to set each pixel separately. The downside is that it
does not work with most external RAM Paks (memory expansions can be
quite easily upgraded by using two diodes and a resistor though, see
chapter Hardware Modifications for details).<br>
<br>
However, it does work with internal RAM and with modified RAM Paks.<br>
When using internal RAM, take care about these two limitiations: Only a
small picture will fit into 1K memory (so the display procedure must
increase horizontal and/or vertical blanking times), and external RAM
must be disconnected (as it'd otherwise disable internal RAM).<br>
<br>
The true hi-res technique is used by the games Guus Flater, Starfight,
and by some demos such like WRX1K.<br>
<br>
The general idea is to move the character set into RAM at 4000h..7FFFh
by setting I to 40..7Fh. Now this does NOT work as expected, ie. as<br>
(I*100h+char*8+linecntr) as for text mode. Both the executed opcode
(character number) and the linecntr value are ignored. Instead, pixels
are directly read from memory at (IR). Each eight bits of each byte
represent eight pixels. The picture is defined in form of a common
monochrome bitmap.<br>
<br>
The bitmap data can be located anywhere in RAM, and as it is not
'executed' as in other display modes, only raw data is required (ie. and
no HALT or RET opcodes need to be attached to each line). Note that only
the lower seven bits of the R register are incremented by the CPU; care
should be taken that it does not overflow within a line. For example, a
bitmap of 256 pixels width (32 bytes) should be aligned to 32 in memory.<br>
<br>
The main display procedure should load the MSB of the current bitmap
line into the I register, and the LSB into the A register, then jump to
a dummy D_FILE display procedure in memory with A15=HIGH. This dummy
procedure should copy the LSB from A into R register, and then execute a
stream of 32 NOP opcodes (00h: Bit 7 indicates not inverted output, Bit
6 disables blanking, data is directly read from (IR), so that the
character number in Bit 0-5 is ignored), and return to the main
procedure - which'd then issue some delays, prepare new address in I and
A and start over with the next line (using the same dummy procedure
again), until the whole screen has been displayed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<table width="100%"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#cccccc"><td><a name="zx80zx81videoblankingandretrace"></a><font size="+2">&nbsp;ZX80/ZX81 Video Blanking and Retrace</font></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
Display becomes white during blanking time. That is: when Bit 15 of the
program counter (PC) is "0", and/or when Bit 6 of the current opcode is
"1". Theoretically the CPU could execute whatever program code during
blanking - however, as there is only limited interrupt feedback, this
time is usually spent on HALT opcodes or other delay loops, required to
keep the CPU synchronized to visible display output.<br>
<br>
<b>Vertical Blanking</b><br>
Upper and lower screen borders are displayed above/below of the actual
picture, the height of these borders depends on the display refresh
rate. The BIOS permanently reads out the preferred refresh rate (50Hz or
60Hz) when checking for keystrokes, and uses this to re-calculate the
desired border height for each frame - allowing to export the ZX to
other countries without having to reboot it ;-)<br>
<br>
<b>ZX80 Vertical Blanking ("PAUSE")</b><br>
The ZX80 points to a HALT opcode in the D_FILE area, which is repeatedly
executed to display blank upper and lower screen borders (much like
empty lines in a collapsed screen). The CPU thus wastes all its energies
just on drawing blank lines (and on decreasing a remaining lines
counter).<br>
<br>
<b>ZX81 Vertical Blanking ("SLOW")</b><br>
Even though the ZX81 supports the above method either, it'd usually use
NMI based blanking which allows program code to be executed during
blanking time. NMIs (non maskable interrupts) are enabled by I/O, the
NMI handler is then called each scanline. The handler increases a
counter and (if the counter does not overflow) returns to the user
program, otherwise it executes a HALT opcode to synchronize the CPU to
the display at one-cycle resolution and terminates the blanking
procedure.<br>
<br>
<b>Horizontal Blanking</b><br>
In both ZX80 and ZX81, the CPU cannot be used to execute user programs
during horizontal blanking periods - it is required to execute delays to
be kept synchronized to video hardware. This could be gained by a
hardcoded delay. However, ZX video is required to support variable
length blanking when using collapsed screens, in that case the width of
the right screen border must be increased when drawing an empty (or
incomplete) line. This is gained by loading a counter value into the R
register (before drawing the line), and terminating the line by a HALT
opcode which is kept executed until Bit 6 of R becomes zero.<br>
<br>
<b>Retrace</b><br>
The cathode ray is moved back to the begin of the scanline / top of
display during horizontal / vertical retrace periods.<br>
Horizontal retrace is generated by the video hardware, so care should be
taken to keep the display procedure synchronized to retrace signals.<br>
Vertical retrace must be manually initiated and terminated by I/O, a
fixed length delay should be issued during v-retrace in order to produce
a stable display.<br>
<br>
<br>
<table width="100%"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#cccccc"><td><a name="zx80zx81videointerruptsintsandnmis"></a><font size="+2">&nbsp;ZX80/ZX81 Video Interrupts (INTs and NMIs)</font></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
<b>INTs</b><br>
Maskable Interrupts (INTs) are generated when Bit 6 of the R (refresh)
register becomes zero. As the R register is incremented once for each
opcode (twice for prefixed opcodes), there is no linear relationship
between clock cycles and refresh cycles.<br>
In the ZX, INTs are used to terminate scanline drawing, the display data
is 'executed' identical as NOP instructions, followed by a HALT opcode
(which is identical as repeated NOPs), so that in this special case (as
both HALTs and NOPs increment R once per 4 clock cycles) INTs can be
used to produce a regular interval.<br>
The above INT/HALT combination is used as variable length delay, which
is required for variable length scanlines (ie. mixed collapsed and
expanded scanlines) only. Fixed length scanlines could be terminated by
hardcoded delays.<br>
In IM 1 (default), the INT handler is located at 0038h in BIOS ROM. INTs
are enabled by EI instruction, and are automatically disabled upon
execution (or when issuing DI instruction).<br>
<br>
<b>NMIs (ZX81 only)</b><br>
Non maskable interrupts (NMIs) are requested during horizontal retrace
time (ie. at the end of each scanline), the CPU is forced into WAIT
state for the duration of NMI request (unless when executing a HALT
opcode which is allowed to complete without WAIT states).<br>
NMIs are used to count the number of drawn scanlines during vertical
blanking periods. This is allowing the user program to be executed in
SLOW mode while drawing upper and lower screen borders, and to pass
control back to the display/retrace procedure once the NMI handler
decides to terminate the blanking period.<br>
The NMI handler is located at 0066h in BIOS ROM (independently of IM
interrupt mode). NMIs are enabled/disabled by I/O instructions - the CPU
cannot disable NMIs (ie. DI/EI has no effect on NMIs).<br>

controller' (overriding the CPU supplied address signals, which outputs the
whole IR register to the address bus) - the special address bits are output

internal, not external RAM can be used to store character data.<br>

<br>
<b>Internal Expansions</b><br>
The ZX80/ZX81 has two variants of A0-A8 address lines: The normal A0-A8 are
from the CPU, and are wired to RAM and Expansion Port. For character set
addressing A0'-A8' are generated by the ULA, and wired to the BIOS ROM.<br>
The dk'tronics/kayde expansions are mounted as internal daughterboard,
plugged to the BIOS ROM chip. That method allows to use the A0'-A8' lines.<br>
<br>
<b>External Expansions</b><br>
The QS expansion connects to expansion port. Accordingly, it must externally
reproduce some of the ULA functionality (latch the character number &amp;
increment the LINECTR) in order to generate its own A0'-A8' signals. The QS
also takes the inverse flag as character MSB (aka A9'), allowing to use 128
different symbols rather than only 64.<br>
<br>
<b>dk'tronics 4K Graphics ROM (plus optional RAM)</b><br>
Contains a 4K EPROM, mapped to 2000h-2FFFh, with seven new character sets (of
64 symbols each), the region at 2E00h-2FFFh is mainly FFh-filled, and
contains only a few USR functions for selecting the new character sets (each
one: "LD A,20h+N*2, LD I,A, RET", except N=7: selects the default ZX81
charset with I=1Eh). As an upgrade option, the board can be fitted with 1K or
2K SRAM, or 4K EPROM (mapped to 3000h-3xFFh). dk'tronics offered 6 programs
for use with the hardware:<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  Asteroids

for others. Only 64 symbols can be used at once, for example one cannot
simultaneously display lower-case letters and numeric digits. Many symbols
(like A-Z) are duplicated in several 64-character banks, so one gets far less
than 512 &lt;different&gt; characters.<br>

neatly"). dk'tronics had adverts in Sinclair User issues 1..8, Kayde had
adverts in the same magazine, issues 4..8.<br>
Note: One or two years later, Kayde also (illegally) cloned Compusounds
patented "Telesound 84" (an add-on for amplifying the Spectrum's ULA sound
via TV).<br>
<br>
<b>QuickSilva QS CHRS board</b><br>
Maps 1K RAM to 8400h-87FFh, allows to define and display 128 characters (64
normal, and, independently thereof, 64 inverted characters) (for example, the
inverse ones can be assigned as lowercase letters).<br>
On power-up, the RAM is uninitialized, so garbage would be displayed.
Quicksilva has "solved" this problem by providing a mechanical switch, where
the user can (must) manually enable/disable the CHRS feature (there is no I/O
port to do this by software). Moreover, the board has 4 DIP switches,
presumably for adjusting HSYNC or so (should be all off for ZX81 in SLOW
mode, or switch 3,4 on for ZX80 and ZX81 in FAST mode) (whereas "FAST" mode
is probably meant to mean PAUSE/INPUT, accordingly software should avoid to
switch between SLOW mode and PAUSE/INPUT).<br>
Depending on the invert bit, the first or second 512 bytes are mirrored to
1E00h on ULA access (however, the CPU is still able to read ROM from 1E00h;
though, eventually, ROM-reading MIGHT work only when the enable switch is
off?)<br>
Emulating the QS CHRS board with its original crude manual enable switch is
easy, but automatically detecting and enabling it is more difficult, possible
ways are: Detect the original driver (won't work with custom drivers), or,
detect if 8400h..87FFh contains data whilst all other RAM at 8000h and up is
zero-filled (or filled with whatever values you stored there on power-up).<br>
<br>
<b>Haven Hardware chrs board</b><br>
Another character thing. Seems to be able to map RAM (or ROM?) to 1E00h-1FFFh
and 3E00h-3FFFh. Low-level details are unknown? (sounds similar to the QS
board)<br>
<br>
<b>AGB UDG graphic card</b><br>
Whatever. Reportedly mirrors 512 byte RAM to 1E00h.<br>
<br>
<b>Memotech UDG Interface</b><br>
Whatever - if it does exist at all. It is mentioned only on one single

<br>
<b>Unknown UDG Type</b><br>
There is a game called "FROGGER-HR" by "E LANTING". It sets I=20h and uses
character RAM at 2000h (similar to dk'tronics/kayde, but having RAM at that
location, not ROM). Unknown which hardware does support this (if any - it's
also possible that the game is homebrewn and works only with emulators).<br>

<b>Memotech HRG</b><br>
Maps 2K EPROM to 2000h-27FFh. The EPROM contains USR function for
high-resolution PLOT and LINE drawing functions. Supported resolution is
248x192. Seems to require a separate RAM expansion for use as video RAM.
Aside from the EPROM, it does contain an overkill of five 74LSxx chips, and
two PAL chips. Low-level details are unknown?<br>

<br>
<b>HRG-MS (Matthias Swatosch)</b><br>
Technically same as Wilf Ritger's hires, but doesn't work unless first
loading an additional software driver from cassette, before loading the
actual program. The driver contains some USR functions for drawing LINEs from
within BASIC - in the BASIC era it would have been revolutionary, nowadays...
it isn't. The driver loading is more than uncomfortable, and BASIC is crap
anyways.<br>

<table width="100%"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#cccccc"><td><a name="zx81videononstandardpicturesize"></a><font size="+2">&nbsp;ZX81 Video Nonstandard Picture Size</font></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
The official picture size is 32x24 tiles (256x192 pixels) with huge borders.
However, on a PAL screen, the ZX81 can display 40x34 tiles (320x272 pixels).<br>
<br>
<b>34-lines Quicksilva Defender</b><br>
Displays 31x32 tiles (the advert claims 34 lines, but it's actually only 32
lines). There's some glitch in the blanking/retrace that causes the topmost
lines to become ultra-bright and horizontally unstable (at least on my
Philips TV Set). Moreover, the framerate is only 43Hz (that part works fine
on my TV Set).<br>
Note: The game was also announced for ZX80 and works without NMI (even the
ZX81 version doesn't use NMIs).<br>
<br>
<b>Wilf Ritger's WRX1K</b><br>

<b>Lambda Color Module</b><br>
External Color Module designed for the Lambda 8300. Contains 1K Color RAM
(with color attributes similar as on ZX Spectrum). Supports 8 colors, but the
palette is still unknown.<br>
It should also work with ZX81, though with some restrictions: The normal ZX81
BIOS doesn't initialize the color attributes on power-up (upon power-on the
module is disabled, displaying a "white-on-white?" picture; to activate color
RAM one needs to init the RAM at 2000h-2FFFh and then enable it via write to
3001h) (the unit isn't re-disabled on warmboot via /RESET, only on power-on),
and the ZX81 doesn't have a composite video output (so one would need some
soldering to extract the monochrome video signal), and, compared to Lambda,
the ZX81 has black/white inverted, so ink/paper will be exchanged.<br>
See Lambda 8300 for details.<br>
<br>
<b>Interface 8 x Couleurs / Carte Couleur (PCB: "DISTR.(C) par S.A.M. 001")</b><br>
A french add-on for the ZX81. Sold by EREL Boutique.<br>
The interface doesn't contain any RAM for storing color attributes. Instead,
it seems to watch the character numbers being read from D_FILE, and applies
one of the 8 colors when seeing CHR numbers 86h..8Dh (aka inverse [A]..[H]
symbols). The palette is unknown. Also unknown if it changes the foreground
and/or background color. Also unknown if the [A]..[H] symbols are displayed,
or if they are masked.<br>
Video Output: Outputs UHF (SECAM) and Peritel (SCART, ie. probably RGB). UHF
output is done using ZX81's internal UHF modulator (requires some soldering)
(the signal can be adjusted by potentiometers on the interface, so colors
might be "user-selectable" rather than having a constant palette?). Peritel
requires a special cable that connects to a spare DIL socket on the interface
(the pin-outs of the socket are unknown, so without the original cable, one
could only guess which pins a R,G,B).<br>
<br>
<b>Carte couleur</b><br>

<b>Memory Overview</b><br>
RAM is originated at 4000h, for 1K RAM: at 4000h-43FFh; 48K: at 4000h-FFFFh,
the area below 4000h is used only when more than 48K are installed.<br>
In the ZX world, memory accesses can be split into three categories: data
read, data write, and opcode read. Opcode read is sensed by the CPUs /M1
signal, and behaves different than normal data read in case that A15 is HIGH,
ie. for addresses in range from 8000h-FFFFh.<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  address     code  read  write

  C000..FFFF  VRAM1 RAM3  RAM3   ;ZX81 with 48K or more RAM (*)
  (*) That, for the RAM3 part, VRAM1 is of course found in all ZX with 16K
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>The memory region 8000h-FFFFh cannot be used to execute machine code
programs; any opcodes in that region with Bit 6 cleared are treated as video
output (and are executed as NOPs).<br>
Opcodes/video data at C000-FFFFh are read from memory at 4000h-7FFFh - the
software should usually write video data into memory at 4000h-7FFF, and
'execute' the data in the mirrored region at C000-FFFF.<br>
<br>
<b>1K RAM</b><br>
Default ZX81 includes only 1K RAM at 4000h-43FFh. However, the default
RAM and ROM select signals are mirroring ROM across 0000h-3FFFh and
8000h-BFFFh, and RAM at 4000h-7FFFh and (including 'data read' accesses)
at C000h-FFFFh.<br>
The ZX81 mainboard provides space for either two 1K x 4bit SRAM chips,
or one 1K x 8bit SRAM chip (with L1 jumper closed).<br>
<br>
<b>2K RAM</b><br>
The american 'ZX81' (Timex TS1000) appears to have been delivered with 2K
internal memory. The socket for 1K x 8bit SRAM on the ZX81 mainboard may be
used (by closing L2 jumper) for a 2K x 8bit SRAM chip.<br>
<br>
<b>16K RAM</b><br>
Even though above described 1K RAM signals are providing memory space
for up to 16K RAM, the Memotech expansions (not sure about Sinclair or
other expansions) are supplying their own RAM and ROM select signals;
ROM is then located at 0000-1FFF only, and RAM at 4000-7FFFh only, all
other areas are unused, typically 'FFh filled'. Except that, video
memory opcode reads (but not data reads) from C000h-FFFFh are mirrored
to 4000h-7FFFh as usually.<br>
Timex TS1500 has been delivered with 16K built-in RAM.<br>
<br>
The 16K RAM configuration may be more or less treated as standard
configuration - programmers should recurse that below expansions of 32K
or more RAM haven't been very popular - thus any programs that require
more than 16K memory won't work on most ZX computers.<br>
<br>
<b>32K RAM</b><br>
RAM is located at 4000h-BFFFh, whereas the upper half may be used to
store data and/or to 'execute' video code, but not for normal machine
code program code.<br>
Note that the BIOS memory detection ends at 8000h, the BIOS will detect
only a maximum of 16K RAM - and the stack pointer will be then initiated
at 8000h. Thus, loading large cassette files will overwrite the stack.
When using more than 16K RAM, the RAMTOP identifier in the system area
must be changed manually by POKE instructions, and then applied by a NEW
instruction (or by a short program that moves stack data and stack
pointers to the new addresses).<br>
Care should be taken that video memory may not cross the 7FFFh/8000h
boundary; Video data at 7FFFh is executed by addressing FFFFh, and thus
the next address will be 0000h instead 8000h! Ie. video memory may be
located in either one of the two 16K blocks, not in both.<br>
<br>
<b>48K RAM</b><br>
RAM is located at 4000h-FFFFh, same restrictions as for 32K RAM apply.
The memory at C000h-FFFFh can be used as data storage only, but not for
machine code execution, and not for video data 'execution'.<br>
When patching the RAMTOP value use the maximum of FFFFh (indicating 48K
minus one byte), as video memory must be below C000h, BASIC program code
is restricted to less than 32K as well, BASIC variables may use the
additional memory though.<br>
Some 16K expansions can be combined with 32K expansions to gain a total
of 48K RAM.<br>
<br>
<b>64K RAM</b><br>
Even though called "64K" expansions, most or all of these expansions do
not seem to support bank switching which'd allow to switch RAM into the
8K BIOS ROM area at 0000h-1FFFh, so only 56K of RAM at 2000h-FFFFh can
be used.<br>
As for 48K RAM, the highest RAMTOP value would be FFFFh, the 'RAMBASE'
is fixed at 4000h, so that the additional memory at 2000h-3FFFh cannot
be used by the BIOS/BASIC interpreter.<br>

<b>Depositing Binary Data/Program in Memory</b><br>
The ZX81 does not directly support loading binary files from cassette,
when using LOAD, a memory image is loaded which contains the BIOS system
variables, the BASIC program, the video memory, and the BASIC variables.<br>
The following are places that can be used as reserved area for binary
code.<br>
<br>
<b>Using a REM instruction (in the program area)</b><br>
Preferably locate the REM in the first line number (ensuring that it is
located at a fixed memory address), the length of the comment must
provide enough space for the program, then use POKE or else to fill the
program code into it.<br>
RESTRICTION: The comment may not contain the value 76h (the NEWLINE
character). Thus, the assembler program should not contain a "HALT"
instruction (opcode 76h), or any other opcodes with operand 76h such
like LD A,76h or JP 4276h etc., or any data definitions such like "DB
76h".<br>
<br>
<b>Using a string (in the variables area)</b><br>
Define a string such like A$ and fill it by binary character numbers.
Note that all variables are saved by SAVE command, it is not necessary
that the program itself contains the LET A$=... definition.<br>
RESTRICTION: The position of the string in memory may change when
(re-)defining other variables, when modifying the BASIC program, or when
altering video memory contents.<br>
<br>
<b>Using memory above RAMTOP (outside of the known memory)</b><br>
By default, RAMTOP (4004h) points to the address following to the
detected RAM area (4400h for 1KByte RAM). The user can alter this
address by using POKE, then type NEW to let the BIOS realize the new
value, all memory above RAMTOP may now be used for whatever purposes.<br>
RESTRICTION: The (standard) SAVE instruction does not save this area to
cassette.<br>
<br>
<br>
<table width="100%"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#cccccc"><td><a name="zx80zx81cassettefileimages"></a><font size="+2">&nbsp;ZX80/ZX81 Cassette File Images</font></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
<b>.81 and .80 Files</b><br>
These are 1:1 copies of the content of real ZX81 and ZX80 cassette files.<br>
ZX81 files are copies of the memory area 4009h up to E_LINE-1, the
filename (which is usually part of ZX81 files) is not included in the
file.<br>
ZX80 files are copies of the memory area 4000h up to E_LINE-1, the
filename is obviously not included as real ZX80 files do not have names.<br>
<br>
<b>.P and .O Files</b><br>
Basically, these are identical as .81 (.P) and .80 (.O) files, except
that an unpredictable amount of garbage is meant to be attached to each
file.<br>
Older versions of the Xtender emulator seem to have attached 1 byte of
garbage. The current Xtender version apparently dropped this behaviour,
and saves correct length. Files at ftp.nvg randomly contain between
28-38 bytes of garbage, probably caused by a cassette-to-disk transfer
program. And some files appear to have went through a CP/M filesystem,
which caused the length to be rounded up to multiples of 128 bytes.<br>
Programs that deal with these files should determine the correct length
(by examining the header/system area), and truncate the extra bytes.<br>
<br>
<b>.P Files with Filename</b><br>
Some .P files contain the original "FILENAME.P" (in ZX81 charset) at 003Fh
(within the PRBUFF area) (the purpose is probably to "preserve" long
filenames in MSDOS) (the preceeding bytes at 003Ch are usually 00-1A-1C, or
in FROGGER-HR: 00-1C-1C (unknown purpose)).<br>
<br>
<b>.TZX Files</b><br>
This format was originally designed for the Spectrum, mainly intended to
encode nonstandard formats (copy-protections / turbo loaders). It can be also
used (via ID 19h) for ZX80/ZX81 programs. The format is quite complicated -
it's advantage is that it can contain more than one file (a feature required
for games that are split into two or more files).<br>
<a href="http://nocash.emubase.de/zxdocs.htm#spectrumcassettetzxformat">Spectrum Cassette TZX Format</a><br>
<br>
<b>.C and .S and .V and .B or else</b><br>
These are not actually real ZX files, programs that include such files won't
work on real ZX81 or ZX80, nor in no$zx. The Xtender emulator includes
several custom functions, allowing the user to create or delete directories
on the harddisk, probably as well as to format it, and to save these kind of
files.<br>

The system area should contain proper data. The entry at 400Ah defines the
end address (used to calculate the file length). Memory at 4028h and up may
be misused for whatever purpose.<br>
Normally, ZX80 files cannot be autostarted - except via "nocash LD H,L trick":<br>

  xx3Dh                   ;End of file (must be at xx3Dh)
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>After loading, the BASIC line is LISTed on the screen. The ZX80 BIOS doesn't
replace invalid tokens in range of 40h..7Fh by question marks, so Token 65h
is written as-is to VRAM (ie. as LD H,L opcode). The file must end at
xx3Dh, so the first character line starts at xx40h, which is (normally)
excecuted 8 times via JP HL from inside of the IRQ handler. After first
execution, the LD H,L opcode changes HL=xx40h to HL=4040h, so the next IRQ
jumps to the autostart entryoint at 4040h. That is still done with IRQs
enabled, so the first opcode at 4040h should be a DI.<br>
Note: Emulators that do not handle opcodes in VRAM should reproduce autostart
as "IF [402Ah]=7665h THEN JP 4040h" after loading the file (that, preferably
with registers and memory initialized as on real hardware).<br>
<br>
<b>Maximum File Length</b><br>
Files should usually not exceed 16 KBytes. The memory detection
procedure in both ZX80 and ZX81 BIOS stops after 16 KBytes (at 8000h),
and initializes the stack pointer at that address, even if more memory
is installed. Thus loading files of 16K or more would destroy the stack
area (unless a separate loader has previously moved the stack area to
another location).<br>
However, most ZXes don't have more than 16K RAM, so bigger files won't
work on most computers anyways.<br>

<br>
<b>File End</b><br>
For both ZX80 and ZX81 the fileend is calculated as shown above. In
either case, the last byte of a (clean) file should be 80h (ie. the last
byte of the VARS area), not followed by any further signals except
eventually video noise.<br>
<br>
<b>Bits and Bytes</b><br>
Each byte consists of 8 bits (MSB first) without any start and stop
bits, directly followed by the next byte. A "0" bit consists of four
high pulses, a "1" bit of nine pulses, either one followed by a silence
period.<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  0:  /\/\/\/\________

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>Each pulse is split into a 150us High period, and 150us Low period. The
duration of the silence between each bit is 1300us. The baud rate is
thus 400 bps (for a "0" filled area) downto 250 bps (for a "1" filled
area). Average medium transfer rate is approx. 307 bps (38 bytes/sec)
for files that contain 50% of "0" and "1" bits each.<br>

anything in range from 7V up to I think 24V. However, a higher voltage
would heat up the regulator even more, and be aware that it is output to

The video output consists of a /SYNC signal (low during horizontal and

<b>50Hz/60Hz Refresh Rate Jumper</b><br>
Even though the display refresh rate is actually software based, the
BIOS determines the local desired rate by reading from I/O port FEh. In
the ZX81, the setting depends on whether Pin 22 of the Ferranti chip is
shortcut to ground or not.<br>
When it is grounded, by a 0 Ohm "resistor" called R 30, then vertical
blanking time is reduced for 60Hz timing - note that this heavily
reduces the user-available CPU time in SLOW mode.<br>

at the end of the upper/lower blanking period). Rewiring the R1 resistor, and

When using "True Hi-Res" software, pixel data is read from RAM rather
than ROM area. Pixel data is requested by a /RFSH (refresh) signal,
rather than by a normal /RD (read) signal. So, RAM is required to output
data whenever when /RD or /RFSH are low.<br>
<br>
Internal RAM does support the above combination, but external RAM
usually generates its own read signal - which senses /RD only. Below
example for fixing this problem is taken from Wilf Ritgers ZX81VID.TXT
document:<br>

The RAMPACK is modified to enable the data output at RFSH time by cutting the
RD and RFSH lines at the edge connector and installing 2 only 1N34A Germanium
diodes and a 4.7K pullup resistor.<br>
<br>
Note: ZX hardware often uses a couple of small RAM chips (instead of a
single 28 pin SRAM chip), anyways these are SRAM chips either (so
cutting the RFSH signal shouldn't cause problems). Ie. you can be quite
sure that no DRAM is used because the refresh register is used as
interrupt counter.<br>

Internally the ZX81 is producing a more or less crystal clear video
signal, which is normally converted into a TV signal by the UHF
modulator in the computer, and then re-decoded by the de-modulator in
the TV Set, most likey resulting in a more than bad display quality.<br>
<br>
Anyways, the 'raw' video signal can be found at pin 16 of the ZX81
Ferranti chip, that is: 0V=Sync, 2.5V=black, 5V=white, which might or
might not work with various types of computer displays. Some displays
might not understand the refresh rates, and others might require other
voltages - which might be adjusted by one or more resistors.<br>
<br>
I've currently only tried to connect a GT65 Green Monitor (for
Amstrad/Schneider CPC homecomputers): Connect Ground as such, and
connect the Video signal to both /Sync, and (preferably through a 1kOHm
resistor) to Luminance. The voltage is apparently much too high (not
actually blowing the display, but the picture appears very bright), the
resistor is more or less healing this.<br>

<table width="100%"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#cccccc"><td><a name="hwgettingridofthe9vdcpowersupply"></a><font size="+2">&nbsp;HW Getting rid of the 9V DC Power Supply</font></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
When connecting the ZX81 to the PC, the external ZX 9V power supply
becomes more or less useless, and it might be recommended to use the PC
supply instead. Two possible methods are:<br>
<br>
<b>Using 12V DC (Yellow cable in PCs)</b><br>
The official ZX so-called-9V-supply actually outputs about 11V, thus the
slightly higher voltage wouldn't cause much more overheat, but keep in
mind that the voltage is forwarded to any connected hardware expansions,
if necessary lower the voltage to approx. 11V by inserting a 1N4004
diode into the 12V line.<br>
<br>
<b>Using 5V DC (Red cable in PCs)</b><br>
The ZX81 is internally operated at 5V only, the additional volts are
just blown into heat by the 7805 voltage regulator. So, connecting 5V
directly to the 7805 output does work (and prevents the keyboard from
heating up). However, the "9V" voltage is output to the expansion port,
and some hardware expansions (including 16K Memotech RAM Paks) actually
require this voltage.<br>
<br>
A separate ground signal isn't forcefully required if the ZX is
connected to the PCs parallel port, as the existing ground/shield
connection could be badly mis-used as ground.<br>
<br>
<br>
<table width="100%"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#cccccc"><td><a name="hwuploadingprogramsfromthepctothezx81"></a><font size="+2">&nbsp;HW Uploading Programs from the PC to the ZX81</font></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
The Transmit function in no$zx Utility menu supports three different transfer
methods, each using the PCs parallel port to output data to the ZX (only into
that direction, not vice versa):<br>
<br>
<b>1) Nocash Highspeed (transmission time 100-1300ms)</b><br>
This is a very simple six-diodes-network. The transmission rate is
approx. 12500 bytes/sec (about 300 times faster than 38 bytes/sec
cassette loading). The ZX is automatically reset and immediately
switched into read-mode, even a huge 16K file is transferred in less
than 1.5 seconds - ways faster than the unpatched ZX81/16K CLS boot
procedure.<br>
However, this method requires a patched BIOS ROM, and it's thus
restricted to more or less serious users only. Data is transferred in
units of 4 Bits, synchronized by a separate clock signal, thus making
the timing rather uncritical, even when using a multitasking operating
system.<br>
<br>
<b>2) Mixed (transmission time 3-4 seconds)</b><br>
This method combines the above/below protocols, but works well without
patched BIOS ROM. Before transmission, you'll have to type LOAD ""
manually on remote side, a small loader will be then transferred by
using the slow transfer method (approx 3 seconds), followed by the
actual file using highspeed transfer (approx 0-1 second).<br>
<br>
<b>3) ZXTAPE (transmission time up to 7 minutes)</b><br>
This protocol is transferring data at original cassette speed (38 bytes per
second), similar to Wilf Ritger's ZXTAPE program. A possible advantage is
that you won't need to open the ZX81, and won't need to install any diodes,
just connect parallel port pin 2 and ground to the ZX EAR socket, and ignore
further instructions below.<br>
Note that this method won't work very well with multi-tasking operating
systems.<br>

Connect the diodes to Pin 3-8 of the Centronics plug. The end with the
black ring (or other color) must point to the plug, the other end will
be connected to the ZX81 mainboard. The diodes are required because
otherwise the strong PC LPT port pulls up the ZX81 address signals when
pressing a key. (Even though bi-directional LPT ports might be able to
avoid that.)<br>
<br>
<b>Step 2 - Connecting the Data Lines.</b><br>
When looking on top of the ZX81 board, you will see the keyboard
connector in lower right. Counted from the right end, pin 1-8 are A8-A15
signals (in no specific order) - ignore these. Pin 9-13 are Keyboard
Columns 0-4 (in exactly that order) - connect these to the diodes at Pin
3-7 of the Centronics plug.<br>
<br>
<b>Step 3 - Connecting Ground, Reset and Cassette.</b><br>
Connect Ground (found at Pin 4B and 5B of the expansion port) to Pin 24
or else of the Centronics plug. Connect Reset (Pin 21A of expansion
port) to the diode at Pin 8 of Centronics plug (the reset signal isn't
actually required, but it's quite comfortable if the transmission
program can reset the ZX81). Finally, connect the Cassette Input (EAR)
to Pin 2 of the Centronics plug (this is required only if you are not
using patched BIOS).<br>
<br>
<b>Step 4 - Connecting the ACK Flipflop (NEW, added 2010)</b><br>
Connect the 74LS74 flipflop as shown above. This is allowing to send feedback
info and EPROM version string to the PC. It's making the circuit a little bit
more complicated than necessary, but it's rather useful to solve connection
problems.<br>
<br>
<b>Software</b><br>
The transmit function (for uploading .P .O .81 .80 files to the ZX80/ZX81) is
found in no$zx's "Utility" menu. The "Utility" menu also contains a function
called Create Patched BIOS Image, which creates a file called XMITZX81.ROM,
which is to be stored in the EPROM; the ROM-image is 16K in size, containing
the original ZX80/ZX81 BIOSes, and the upload software.<br>
Keep in mind that some pins of the ROM socket must be reconnected for
EPROM use (see chapter about replacing BIOS ROM by EPROM).<br>
<br>
<b>Joystick Compatibility</b><br>
When having a joystick connected to the ZX keyboard lines as well, then
above nocash/mixed transfer methods may not work. This can be fixed by
disconnecting the joystick, or by inserting diodes (1N4148 or else) into
the joystick connectors data lines (Keyboard Bits 1-4).<br>
Due to the rather high transfer rate, the incoming signal will run into
the joystick cable, and as there are no 'terminators' (resistors) at the
end of the cable (as for ethernet networks for example), the signal will
'bounce back' at the cable end and run back to the ZX, confusing the
transmission program that simultaneously wants to read arrived data.<br>
<br>
<b>History</b><br>
2002 - original circuit for zx81<br>
2010 - added feedback-flipflop, added zx80 support, changed eprom content<br>

The original spectrum did use only one I/O address (the ULA at port FEh). And
only one pre-assigned expansion I/O address (the ZX printer at port FDh).
Although that original design was very simple, the lack of further
pre-assigned addresses resulted in a mess. For example, there are at least 5
different "standards" for connecting joysticks, 3 for PSG sound chips
(probably more), many dozens of floppy and centronics standards, etc.<br>

<b>Expansion ROM/RAM</b><br>
On Spectrum machines, the 16K ROM at 0000h-3FFFh (or smaller portions of it)
can be externally disabled by dragging the /ROMCS pin HIGH, allowing to
replace that region by external ROM and/or RAM. (Eg. Interface 1 ROM or
Interface 2 ROM, or Interface 2 Cartridge ROM) (also external disk drives
usually contain both ROM and RAM).<br>
Timex machines don't have external /ROMCS pin, instead, the memory mapping is
handled via the internal Port F4h and FFh registers. And, Timex machines can
map external memory anywhere at 0000h..FFFFh (rather than at 0000h-3FFFh
only).<br>

In 48 BASIC mode, all the variables and routines below 5C00h (23552) do not
exist; instead there is a buffer between 5B00h (23296) and 5C00h (23552)
which is used for controlling the printer. This was quite a popular location
for small machine code programs on the old 48K Spectrum, and if any of these
routines are tried in +3 BASIC, the computer will invariably crash. Any old
program that uses PEEK, POKE and USR is therefore a safer bet if it is run in
48 BASIC mode (although it can be entered in +3 BASIC mode and transferred
using the SPECTRUM command). If there is a chance that a program might
inadvertently address the added I/O ports of the +3, then 'OUT 32765,48' will
set bit 5 in port 7FFDh to disable further use of the added ROM/RAM
switching.<br>

<b>Port FFh (or other) (R) Spectrum Current VRAM Data (dirt effect)</b><br>
Reading from an unused port (eg. Port FFh) does return the byte being most
recently read from VRAM via video DMA. During Vblank and Hblank, the return
value is always FFh. During the scanline drawing periods, the return value
may be FFh, or bitmap data, or attribute data (depending on when exactly the
port is read).<br>
Some games are using this dirt effect to synchronize the program with the
cathode ray beam (eg. Arkanoid is using display timings to generate in-game
sound frequencies).<br>
The method does NOT work on all computers: All Timex machines are using Port
FFh for something else, though the effect may still work with other unused
ports (if there are any unused ports). And, newer Spectrum machines (eg.
Spectrum +3) don't produce the effect at all.<br>

White/Gray tend to appear a bit yellowish.<br>

is almost same as Bright Blue, and Dark Cyan or Dark Yellow are almost same
as Bright Green).<br>

Pin 1 is composite PAL, 2 is GND. The picture is a bit dull unless your TV's
video input is High Z (high impedance) However, that's quite unlikely.
Normally the impedance of the video input is around 75 Ohms. To alleviate
this problem, short the 68 Ohms resistor inside the Speccy that's in series
with pin 1 (follow the track on the PCB). Or you can hook it directly to the
input of the RF modulator.<br>

<b>Some Clones</b><br>
The russian Scorpion seems to have same timings as Spectrum 48K. The russian
Pentagon has 320 lines total (64+192+48+16), and, it generates INT at begin
of its 16-lines Vsync period (all other computers have INT at end of Vsync,
aka begin of upper border). Horizontal total is 224 clks on both Pentagon and
Scorpion, but hsync position is slightly different on each. Both Scorpion and
Pentagon do not have slow (contended) memory.<br>
<br>
<b>VRAM Waitstates (aka "contended memory" waitstates)</b><br>
Within each 8 cycles, the ULA reads 2 bitmap bytes and 2 attribute bytes via
video DMA (which takes up 4 clks), followed by 4 cycles where bus is free for
the CPU. Although there are 4 free cycles, the ULA allows the CPU to invoke a
RAM access (or a Port FEh access) only during 2 of that 4 cycles:<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  UUUUUUccUUUUUUccUUUUUUcc..   ;&lt;--- U=Blocked by ULA, c=Free for CPU access

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>Waitstates occur only during drawing, ie. not during Vblank and Hblank. The
first ULA access appears 14335 (or 14361) cycles after the Vsync IRQ (or
unknown number of cycles on NTSC and others). The above access pattern is
then repeated throughout the 128 cycles drawing time, and pauses throughout
the 96 (or 100) cycles hblank time.<br>
Although a screen with attributes consists of only 6.75Kbytes, the waitstates
apply on any access to memory chips that are connected to the ULA (ie. the
whole 16K at 4000h..7FFFh) (or one half of RAM on 128K machines, either in
banks 1,3,5,7 on Spectrum 128/+2, or in banks 4,5,6,7 on Spectrum +2A/+3).
Other portions of RAM (and ROM) can be accessed without waitstates.<br>
<br>
<b>Details on VRAM-DMA Access Timings</b><br>
As said above, within each 8 cycles, the ULA reads 2 bitmap bytes and 2
attribute bytes, the LSBs of the bitmap address are the same as of the
attribute address, so two bytes (1x bitmap, and 1x attr) can be fetched with
a single long /RAS signal (1.5 clks low) and two short /CAS signals (0.5 clks
low):<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>                  |-----8 clks----||-----8 clks----|-----H/V-Blank...------
  /RAS (RAM.Pin4)  -___-___---------___-___--------------------------------
  /CAS (RAM.Pin15) -_-_-_-_---------_-_-_-_--------------------------------
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>During drawing, the ULA outputs all /RAS addresses in range 00h..7Fh (though
not in linear order) to the memory, so the above /RAS signals do also serve
as refresh signals.<br>
<br>
<b>Details on CPU Access Timings</b><br>
CPU memory accesses are slower than video DMA (the CPU outputs /CAS and /RAS
low for 1.5 clks, while DMA uses only 0.5 clks for /CAS). Normally, the CPU
does also output a "dummy" /RAS for refresh (1.0 clks low), so a stream of
NOP opcodes would look like so:<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>                  |-----8 clks----||-----8 clks----|
  /RAS (RAM.Pin4)  -___-__--___-__--___-__--___-__-   ;four NOP opcodes
  /CAS (RAM.Pin15) -___-----___-----___-----___----
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>When accessing "contended" memory, the ULA takes care of refresh, so the
CPU's refresh signal can be suppressed, and a stream of NOP opcodes would
look like so (assuming that no VRAM-DMA is taking place, eg. during Hblank):<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>                  |-----8 clks----||-----8 clks----|
  /RAS (RAM.Pin4)  -___-----___-----___-----___----   ;four NOP opcodes
  /CAS (RAM.Pin15) -___-----___-----___-----___----
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
<b>Scanline Effects</b><br>
The Spectrum doesn't have a Scanline interrupt, so changing video attributes
in specfic scanlines (for using more than 2 colors per 8x8 pixels), or
changing the horizontal resolution in a given scanline (on Timex machines)
can be implemented only by waiting so-and-so-many clock cycles after the
Vsync interrupt has occurred. That method wastes a lot of CPU load, and its
difficult to get it compatible with all computers (due to different
horizontal and vertical timings, and different waitstates).<br>
Another approach would be reading from Port FFh (or other unused ports), and
to wait until contains a specific color attribute, that method is more
flexible than hardcoded delays, but, it doesn't work on all computers (see
Port FFh info in ULA chapter for details).<br>
<br>
<b>Refresh and Snow</b><br>
The Z80 CPU generates refresh signals used for the non-contended RAM only.<br>
The contended VRAM uses a different refresh signal generated from the ULA.<br>
Although contended VRAM doesn't use CPU refresh signal, the ULA can get
"confused" when the CPU refresh occurs with the address bus containing a
contended memory address (ie. when the IR register pair points to
4000h..7FFFh; aka when the I register is 40h..7Fh), in that case the ULA
thinks that the CPU wants to access memory, causing the ULA not to load new
data from VRAM (and to re-use old data), which results in "snow" on the
screen. On Spectrum 128K/+2, the snow effect does exist, but it does
reportedly "crash the machine shortly after I is set to point to contended
memory".<br>
Hmmm.......... assuming that the effect doesn't just block VRAM reads, but
also VRAM refresh.... then it actually CRASH programs (and BIOS code) that
have code/data located in the "contended" memory regions.... eg. the 16K
spectrum has ONLY contended memory, so the program would survive on a few
seconds or so.... the reported crash on 128K/+2 might have the same reason
(but could be simply avoided by using only uncontended memory)...?<br>

<b>Sound Frequency vs Video Waitstates</b><br>
Observe that video waitstates occur when drawing the bitmap area (but not
during Hblank and Vblank), so the presence/absence of waitstates can have
some nasty effects on software generated sound frequencies.<br>
Basically, do not use code/data in RAM at 4000h..7FFFh when generating
sounds. Waitstates do also occur on accessing Port FEh, which may become a
problem with high-frequency PWM sounds, a workaround would be to access Port
FEh only within multiples of 8 clock cycles (so it runs in sync with video
DMA).<br>
Aside from waitstates, it may be also good to disable IRQs to prevent the
sound to get paused during IRQ handling (or at least to use a custom fast IRQ
handler).<br>
<br>
<b>Sound Volume via Bit3 (not recommended / unstable results)</b><br>
The ULA has two separate control bits for Sound and Cassette output:<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  Port FEh.Bit4 = Audio Output     (0 = 0.3 Volts, 1 = 3.7 Volts)
  Port FEh.Bit3 = Cassette Output  (0 = 0.3 Volts, 1 = 0.7 Volts)
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>However, it does output both signals on the same pin.<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  Port FEh = 18h --&gt; 3.7V
  Port FEh = 10h --&gt; 3.6V
  Port FEh = 08h --&gt; 0.7V
  Port FEh = 00h --&gt; 0.3V
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>Below are examples for a Spectrum 48K with Issue 2 mainboard; one column
shows results for the internal speaker, the other column shows results for
the MIC output passed to an external amplifier (eg. to the Audio Input of a
TV set). Furthermore, results may differ on other mainboards (after issue 2,
Sinclair seem to have added a transistor as internal amplifier).<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  Toggle between     Internal Speaker     External Amplifier

  10h and 18h        Volume = ##...       Volume = #....      ;unpredictable
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>Normally, sound should be generated by toggling bit4 of Port FEh. As shown
above, messing with bit3 has rather unpredictable results; toggling between
00h and 08h has a good voltage difference which is audible on external
amplifiers, but not enough amperes to drive the internal speaker; for
toggling between 10h and 18h it's vice versa, the voltage difference is
smaller, but there are more amperes (it becomes audible on internal speaker,
but the volume drops with external amplifier).<br>
<br>

<b>Internal Speaker (Spectrum 16K/48K/Plus and Timex TS/TC20xx)</b><br>
Older Spectrums with 16K/48K RAM are containing an internal speaker, used to
output the ULA sound (and PSG sound in case of the Timex 2068). The
dimensions (and volume) of the internal speaker would be more suitable for
headphones. The TV modulator generates a raw video signal (so the TV speaker
is not used).<br>
<br>
<b>Internal Audio UHF Modulator (Spectrum 128/+2/+2A/+3)</b><br>
Newer Spectrums with 128K RAM don't include an internal speaker, instead, the
ULA sound (and PSG sound) is passed to the TV set via the UHF modulator.<br>
<br>
<b>External Speakers/Amplifiers and Modulators</b><br>
To "boost" the volume, several companies offered external amplifiers with
bigger external speakers. Most external PSG/Speech devices do also mix and
amplify the ULA sound with the PSG/Speech sound.<br>
For using the TV speakers, several companies have offered internal and
external UHF modulators which mixed the audio signal with the video signal
(for modern TVs with A/V inputs sets it'd be easier/cheaper to pass MIC/VID
to A/V input of the TV set, which'd also give better picture quality than
UHF).<br>
<br>
<b>External Sound Connectors</b><br>
In general, sound can be obtained from the MIC port (or anywhere from the
mainboard). The Timex TS2068 does also output PSG/ULA on the expansion port.
The Spectrum expansion Port doesn't have a sound output (however, external
hardware could easily reconstruct ULA sound by latching D4 upon /IORQULA and
/WR). The analogue RGB output on the Spectrum +2A/+3 does also include an
audio pin (unlike the TTL RGB output on the Spectrum 128).<br>
<br>
<b>Mono/Stereo Sound</b><br>
The standard spectrum hardware supports only mono sound output. Some of the
external PSG devices allow to produce stereo sounds by passing one PSG
channel to left, one to right, and the third channel to both left and right
speakers; but, external PSG devices are rarely supported by any games, and
there's no real standard which channel is passed to which speaker.<br>

in most cases the clock and divider is unknown (the CPU clock on the

output toggles between +VOL and NULL (not between +VOL and -VOL).<br>
Digitized samples can be written to the volume registers (mind that volume is
non-linear). When doing that, it's best to switch the channel to constant
HIGH level (by disabling both Tone and Noise). Another method would be to set
tone frequency to 000h or 001h (the resulting frequency is too high to be
audible, so the HIGH/LOW levels sound like a constant HALF level).<br>

<b>DK'Tronics Speech Synthesiser - Software Driver</b><br>
The DK'Tronics hardware doesn't include a BIOS/BASIC extension ROM, but, the
BASIC demonstration program includes a machine code driver, which allows the
LPRINT command with backslash to be used to output speech, eg.:<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  LPRINT "\d k tronics"
  LPRINT "print this\speak this"
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>the DK'Tronics driver does attempt to properly pronounce words automatically,
without needing to use special codes like (aa) (dth) as used by Currah.<br>
<br>
<b>0007h - Cheetah Sweet Talker - Speech Output (halts CPU) (W)</b><br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  0-5  SP0256-AL2 Allophone number
  6-7  Unknown
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>This poor piece of hardware doesn't seem to have a status register that
indicates when new data can be sent, instead, it does simply HALT the CPU
when speech is busy. Not sure if halting is bound to the SBY or /LRQ pin (?)
(in the latter case one could still execute some program code when
implementing complex timings in software).<br>
<br>
<b>Read from Memory Address 0038h - Enable/Disable Currah uSpeech BIOS</b><br>
Reading from this memory address enables/disables the 2K uSpeech BIOS (and
probably also the uSpeech command/status register), ie. on each second read
it gets enabled (at 0000h..07FFh), on each other read it gets disabled.<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  0-7  Data/Opcode from the (newly) activated ROM
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>Usually the enable takes place when the CPU jumps to the vblank IRQ handler
at 0038h, which is then redirected to the uSpeech BIOS, which does then do
it's job, and jumps to 0038h, which re-enables the Spectrum BIOS and executes
the normal IRQ handler.<br>
There are no further BIOS hooks; initialization (upon reset) is also done
from inside of the hooked IRQ handler.<br>
<br>
<b>Read from Memory Address 1000h - Currah uSpeech Status (R)</b><br>
This port is probably accessible only when enabled via address 0038h.<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  0    Load Request (LRQ) (1=Buffer full, 0=Ready to receive data)
  1-7  Unknown/unused
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>Bit0 seems to be the /LRQ pin of the SP0256 chip. Unknown if the SBY pin
(indicating when all data is finished) is also found in this register?<br>
The size of the buffer is unknown, maybe it can only hold only a single value
(additionally to the sound being currently played)...?<br>
<br>
<b>Write to Memory Address 1000h - Currah uSpeech Output (W)</b><br>
This port is probably accessible only when enabled via address 0038h.<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  0-5  SP0256-AL2 Allophone Number (00h..3Fh)
  6    Intonation       (0=Decrease Pitch, 1=Increase Pitch)
  7    Unknown/unused   (should be zero)
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>Data can be written to this register when the Status.Bit0 indicates ready
(not sure happens when it doesn't). The last allophone should be followed by
a pause (eg. 00h=Pause10ms), otherwise the SP0256 does reportedly gets stuck
repeating the last allophone (not sure what gets repeated exactly, maybe it
repeats only the end of the last allophone, ie. "shhhhhhh" for "sh", or maybe
the whole last allophone, ie. "shshshsh"?)<br>
The intonation bit seems to be a special feature of the Currah hardware (not
a feature of the SP0256 voice chip itself). Unknown how it is implemented...
it might modify the CLK passed to the SP0256... so, aside from the frequency,
this would also alter the durations, ie. the length of a "100ms" pause would
vary... or it might modify whatever kind of external low-pass and/or
high-pass filter...? The intonation does increase step-by-step (rather than
changing abruptly from low to high)... the stepping rate, and the max/min
values are unknown?<br>
<br>
<b>Currah uSpeech Mirrors of 0038h and 1000h and ROM</b><br>
Reads from memory address 0038h are also mirrored to reads from I/O address
0038h (used by Rockfall to detect the uSpeech), apparently the port is
decoded by checking only A0..A15 and /RD.<br>
For address 1000h it's still unknown if there are mirrors, possibly, only
/RD, /WR, A12, A14, A15 are decoded (probably together with the uSpeech BIOS
enable flag which gets set/cleared via 0038h); if so, mirrors would occur at
1000h-1FFFh and 3000h-3FFFh in both memory and I/O region? If so, using the
I/O mirrors would be not too recommended since they could conflict with other
internal/external I/O ports.<br>
For the ROM it's unknown if it's mirrored, too. Might be mirrored to
800h..FFFh and 2000h-2FFFh?<br>
<br>
<b>Currah uSpeech BIOS/BASIC extension</b><br>
Unlike most or all other speech devices, the Currah hardware includes a BIOS
extension. Currah related BASIC commands are:<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  LET keys=0           ;disable spoken keystrokes (recommended for LOAD/SAVE)
  LET keys=1           ;enable spoken keystrokes (default)
  LET s$="he(ll)(oo)"  ;say hello (normal lowercase)
  LET s$="hE(ll)(oO)"  ;say hello (with raised intonation on "e" and "(oo)")
  PAUSE 1              ;wait for Vblank IRQ (where s$ is processed)
  CLEAR n              ;change RAMTOP (speech buffer is between RAMTOP and UDG)
  IF PEEK(65364)=81    ;buffer pointer LSB, [FF54h]=51h=buffer_empty (on 48K)
  IF s$(TO 1)="*"      ;check if s$ was processed (copied to speech buffer)
  IF s$(TO 1)="?"      ;check if s$ was rejected (contained invalid characters)
  IF s$(TO 1)=other    ;check if s$ was not yet processed (or buffer full)
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>On power up, the Currah BIOS allocates 256 bytes between RAMTOP and UDG,
containing a 6-byte "header", and a 250-byte buffer; which contains allophone
numbers (and intonation flag in bit6), in the format as written to address to
1000h (ie. not in ASCII format as used in the BASIC s$ variable). On the
Spectrum this region is at FFxxh (on Spectrum 16K it's at 7Fxxh):<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  FF57h - Flag byte
  FF56h - Spare (unused general purpose byte; NOT reserved for anything)
  FF55h - Hi byte of buffer pointer ;\contains FF51h when empty
  FF54h - Lo byte of buffer pointer ;/
  FF53h - Spare (unused general purpose byte; NOT reserved for anything)
  FF52h - Spare (unused general purpose byte; NOT reserved for anything)
  FF51h..FE58h - Speech buffer (default size=250) [FF51h]=next allophone
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>In BASIC, the spoken keystrokes and s$ strings are good for a first "oh it
does really speak" impression, although after soon, the keystroke feature may
become annoying, and the automatic modification of the first character in s$
may cause compatibility problems with various BASIC programs that do use s$
for other purposes.<br>
Moreover, allocating 256 bytes between RAMTOP and UDG may cause problems with
many machine code programs. And, hooking the IRQ handler changes Vblank
handling timings which may also cause problems with a few programs.<br>
<br>

<table width="100%"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#cccccc"><td><a name="spectrumsoundspeechsp0256voicegenerator"></a><font size="+2">&nbsp;Spectrum Sound Speech SP0256 Voice Generator</font></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
<b>Voice Generator</b><br>
The voice generator relies on the Amplitude, Pitch, F0..F5, and B0..B5
registers, which are processed like so:<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  Amplitude   --&gt; F0 --&gt; F1 --&gt; F2 --&gt; F3 --&gt; F4 --&gt; F5 --&gt; PWM --&gt; External
  Pitch/Noise     B0     B1     B2     B3     B4     B5             5kHz Filter
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>Another important register is the Repeat counter, which indicates when the
next opcode shall be executed (and which may then load new values into the
above registers).<br>
<br>
<b>Sample Rate and Repeat Timings</b><br>
The SP0256 is (usually) driven by a 3.12MHz oscillator, and it uses 7bit PWM
output, which is clocked at 3.12MHz/2. To obtain a 10kHz sample rate, the
chip issues some dummy steps with constant LOW level additionally to the 128
steps needed for 7bit PWM, making it a total number of 156 steps per sample.<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  Sample Rate = 3.12MHz/2/156 = 10.0kHz   ;100us per sample
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>Which means one sample is 100us long, that value multiplied by 64 or 91 gives
the following timings per repeat:<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  6.4ms per repeat (noise and pause), or
  9.1ms per repeat (tone with pitch=91)
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>Note: Some speech interfaces have the chip overclocked to 4MHz, resulting in
higher pitch &amp; sample rate, and shorter timings as with the normal 3.12MHz.<br>
<br>
<b>Amplitude/Pitch/Repeat</b><br>
The 8bit amplitude register defines the volume in floating point form,<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  Amplitude = lower5bit SHL upper3bit
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>The pitch defines the frequency, counted in numbers of samples per period.<br>
For pitch=91, one HIGH sample (amplitude) is output, followed by 90 zero
samples (null). That pattern is repeated as many times as specified in the
repeat count, for example, with repeat=3:<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>                                  __ Amplitude level (+)
  |        |        |
  |________|________|________     __ Zero level             PITCH
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  &lt;-Pitch-&gt;                       __ Amplitude level (-)
  &lt;--------repeat=3---------&gt;
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>As shown above, the generated waveform is NOT a square wave (which would have
50% high, and 50% low). After applying filters, the final waveform may look
somewhat like so:<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>                                  __ Amplitude level (+)
  |        |        |
  |_|_.____|_|_.____|_|_.____     __ Zero level             PITCH+FILTERS
   | |      | |      | |
   |        |        |            __ Amplitude level (-)
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>Note that (aside from noise) the AL2 ROM uses only one pitch value: 5Bh aka
91 decimal (meaning that all vowels are using the same base frequency, and
they differ only by using different filter settings).<br>
<br>
<b>Amplitude/Noise/Repeat</b><br>
Noise is activated when setting pitch=0. The timings are then same as when
pitch=64, but instead of outputting HIGH and NULL levels, the hardware does
now randomly output HIGH or LOW levels, for example, pitch=0 and repeat=5:<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>                                  __ Amplitude level (+)
  ||| || |  | |  || |   || ||| |
  |||_|| |__|_|__||_|___|| |||_|  __ Zero level             NOISE
     |  | || | ||  | |||  |   |
  &lt;-64-&gt;| || | ||  | |||  |   |   __ Amplitude level (-)
  &lt;----------repeat=5----------&gt;
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>The exact random algorithm is unknown (probably some shift/xor stuff?), the
random levels seem to be output on each sample (not only on the first sample
of a repeat). Like normal pitch, the noise is passed to the 6 filters.<br>
<br>
<b>Pause/Repeat</b><br>
The pause command sets amplitude=0. The timings are then same as when
pitch=64, but the output is always NULL, for example, pause and repeat=5:<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>                                  __ Amplitude level (+)
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  ______________________________  __ Zero level             PAUSE (SILENCE)
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  &lt;-64-&gt;                          __ Amplitude level (-)
  &lt;----------repeat=5----------&gt;
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>Pause does reset the filters to 0, so the silence is not affected by filters.<br>
<br>
<b>Digital Filters</b><br>
As shown above, the amplitude/pitch/noise output is passed through six
digital filter stages (using the F0..F5 and B0..B5 registers), each stage
looks like so:<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>                      _____                      _____
  ------------------&gt;|     |-------------------&gt;|     |-----+-----&gt;
           _____     | SUB |          ______    | SUB |     |
     +---&gt;| *B  |---&gt;|_____|    +---&gt;| *2*F |--&gt;|_____|     |
     |    |_____|     _____     |    |______|    _____      |
     +---------------|OLDER|&lt;---+---------------| OLD |&lt;----+
                     |_____|                    |_____|
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>Ie. the incoming samples are adjusted like so:<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  for i=0 to 5                                         ;filter number
    sample = sample - quant_table[F.i] * OLD.i * 2     ;F0..F5 registers
    sample = sample - quant_table[B.i] * OLDER.i       ;B0..B5 registers
    OLDER.i = OLD.i
    OLD.i   = sample
  next i
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>Whereas, quant_table is a non-linear translation table that translates the
signed 8bit registers to signed 10bit factors (with 9bit fractional part, ie.
511 means 0.99), with following entries:<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  0  ,9  ,17 ,25 ,33 ,41 ,49 ,57 ,65 ,73 ,81 ,89 ,97 ,105,113,121

<b>Memory</b><br>
The SP0256 can address 60Kbytes (480Kbits) of internal or external ROM,
however, usally the ROMs are only 2Kbytes (16Kbit). The ROM contains plain
program code, without any kind of data arrays.<br>
The upper 4bit of the program counter cannot be zero, so the memory starts at
byte-address 1000h, and ends at FFFFh. The first 512 bytes are entrypoints,
usually containing JUMP opcodes for up to 256 allophones or words.<br>
The opcodes and their parameters are transferred serially, LSB first (except,
for some reason, the JUMP/CALL/SETPAGE "Target" values are MSB first).<br>
The JUMP/CALL/RET opcodes can address only byte-aligned addresses, however,
opcodes aren't always multiples of 8bits in size, so following opcodes may
begin on any bit boundary.<br>

to other values in range 01h..0Fh via SETPAGE).<br>
CALL pushes the 16bit byte-aligned return address onto stack, and marks the
stack as not empty. The previous contents of the stack are lost (the stack is
only one entry deep).<br>

next byte after the most recent CALL opcode), and marks the stack as empty.<br>
If the stack was already empty: Enters HALT state until/unless new data
is/was input via /ALD pin. As soon as new data is available, it jumps to
1000h+data*2.<br>
Note: HALT state stops program execution, but does not stop the sound
generator - to obtain silence, issue a short PAUSE (or another opcode that
sets amplitude=0).<br>

coefficients. The 2s complement updates for the various filter coefficients
only update some of the MSBs -- the LSBs are unaffected. The exact bits which
are updated are noted above.<br>
Normal 2s complement arithmetic is performed, and no protection is provided
against overflow. Adding 1 to the largest value for a bit field wraps around
to the smallest value for that bitfield.<br>
Notes: The delta update is applied only once (even if the repeat count is
bigger than 1).<br>
The delta updates are applied to the 8-bit encoded forms of the coefficients,
not the 10-bit decoded forms.<br>
The update to the amplitude register is a normal 2s complement update to the
entire register. This means that any carry/borrow from the mantissa will
change the value of the exponent. The update doesn't know anything about the
format of that register.<br>
<br>
<b>Program Counter and Stack Note</b><br>
As seen in the datasheets for external speech ROMs, the Program Counter &amp;
Stack seem to be part of the ROM (not of the microprocessor). So, when using
external ROMs, one would theoretically have separate stacks for each ROM. NB.
this explains why the Target values are reversed; apparently the ROMs use
different bit-order (for memory addresses) than the microprocessor does for
its own values (ie. the opcodes and voice-parameters).<br>
<br>
<b>Credits</b><br>
The SP0256 opcodes were reverse engineered by Joe Zbiciak and Frank Palazzolo.<br>
<br>
<b>Repeat Count = 0</b><br>
According to Joe and Frank, a repeat count of zero "causes the instruction to
not execute" (and not to fetch any of its following paramters, so the opcode
becomes only 8bits long; or to fetch, but not apply them?), however, they've
also mentioned that "conflicting documentation suggests there's more going
on".<br>
<br>
<b>XXX...</b><br>
Bit fields narrower than 8 bits are MSB justified unless specified otherwise,
meaning that the least significant bits are the ones that are missing. These
LSBs are filled with zeros.<br>
<br>
When updating filter coefficients with a delta-update, the microsequencer
performs plain 2s-complement arithmetic on the 8-bit value in the coefficient
register file. No attention is paid to the format of the register.<br>

keep repeating the end of the allophone until receiving a new allophone). To
mute the voice generator, output a short pause (eg. PA1) after your last

The "Funny" timings are from the SP0256-AL2 data sheet (these values are
totally wrong). The "Actual" timings are calculated from the pitch/repeat

<b>SP0256-019 (or rather SP0256B-019) Allophone/Word/Phrase List</b><br>
This chip is used in "The Voice", an expansion module for the Odyssey 2. The
chip contains the following allophones and words:<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  80h..BFh Allophones (same as 00h..3Fh on SP0256-AL2)    C0h "Enemy"

  C9h "Do it again"   CAh "Incredible" FAh "U.F.O."       FBh "Monster!"
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>Not sure why bit7 is set in the codes (it should be written like so to the O2
I/O ports, but maybe the bit isn't actually passed to the SP0256 chip)?<br>
Additionally, the expansion module contains 3 built-in speech ROMs with sound
effects and various words/phrases like "Amazing", "Come on", "Outch", etc.
Moreover, Odyssey 2 game cartridges can contain up to 5 external speech ROMs.

The SP0256B is reportedly expandable to "480 K of ROM" (probably K=Kbits).<br>
The TEST pin of the SP0256 chip can be used (among others) to dump its
internal ROM. Note: Details on TEST are found in the "SP0256B" datasheet -
but not in the "SP0256" datasheet - not sure if the pin works identical for
both chip types, nor if there's a difference between them at all.<br>

<b>Timex FDD Interface</b><br>
The interface uses a logic circuit to page in the 4KB FDD ROM whenever there
is a call to 0x0000 or 0x0008 and page it out again whenever there is a call
to 0x0604. When it is needed the FDD ROM is paged in at 0x0000 and 0x1000 and
the area 0x2000-0x3fff holds eight copies of 1K of RAM or four copies of 2K
of RAM. The disk drive is controlled by port 0xef<br>
<br>
<b>NMI Snapshot Button</b><br>
Many disk interfaces have a NMI button, allowing to save a snapshot of the
RAM and CPU registers to disk. Since most spectrum programs are sold on
cassettes, this is a useful feature; allowing to "copy" the program to disk,
it can be also useful for saving game postition on disks in games that don't
support saving (or that only support saving to cassette).<br>

The standard media for Spectrum software are regular Audio Cassettes. Instead
of supporting disk drives, Sinclair has focused on selling Microdrive
Cartridges as alternative media, until, finally Amstrad released an
"official" disk drive in the Spectrum +3. However, at that time third-party
companies have had already produced various disk drives, all incompatible
with each other, using different controllers, I/O ports, BIOSes, file
systems, and different physical dimensions (2.8", 3", 3.5", and 5.25").<br>

<b>.TAP Files (Standard Cassette-Image for normal unprotected files)</b><br>
A .TAP file can contain one or more spectrum file(s). Each file should
usually consist of two blocks (header and data). Each block is preceeded by a
16bit length value (eg. 0013h for Header blocks), followed by "length" bytes
which contain the same information as stored on real cassettes (including the
leading Blocktype byte, and ending Checksum byte).<br>
TAP files do not contain pilot/sync pulses, nor baudrate information, so they
can be used only for standard files (as used by the BIOS functions), not for
copyprotected software.<br>

turbo loader block cannot be used. This is not like a VOC file, since the
information is much more compact. Each sample value is represented by one bit
only (0 for low, 1 for high) which means that the block will be at most 1/8
the size of the equivalent VOC.<br>
The preferred sampling frequencies are 22050 or 44100 Hz (158 or 79
T-states/sample), this will ensure correct playback when using PC's
soundcards. Please, if you can, don't use other sampling frequencies.<br>

<b>ID 17h - C64 Turbo Tape Data Block (length: [00h..03h]+0 or 4?) (v1.13 only)</b><br>
These two blocks were defined (although rarely/never used) in TZX version
v1.13 only, intended to support Commodore 64 files.<br>
Bug: Blocks invented after v1.10 are stated to have a length of
"[00h..03h]+4" bytes, while the C64 blocks invented in v1.13 were ALSO stated
by "[00h..03h]" in length, so it's somewhat unclear how to the C64 blocks.

then the emulator or utility should (in effect) STOP THE TAPE, ie. it should
make a pause of infinite length (until the user or emulator requests to
restart the tape motor). As usually, the first 1 ms of the pause must be

one single (composite) block. This is very handy for tapes that use lots of
subblocks like Bleepload (which may well have over 160 custom loading
blocks). You can also give the group a name (example 'Bleepload Block 1').<br>
For each group start block, there must be a group end block. Nesting of

For simplicity reasons don't nest loop blocks!<br>
<br>
<b>ID 25h - Loop end (length: 0) (v1.10 and up)</b><br>

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>This block is an analogue of the CALL Subroutine statement. It basically
executes a sequence of blocks that are somewhere else and then goes back to
the next block. Because more than one call can be normally used you can
include a list of sequences to be called. The 'nesting' of call blocks is
also not allowed for the simplicity reasons. You can, of course, use the CALL
blocks in the LOOP sequences and vice versa. The value is relative for the
obvious reasons - so that you can add some blocks in the beginning of the
file without disturbing the call values. Please take a look at 'Jump To
Block' for reference on the values.<br>

will be the block after the last CALL block (or the next Call, if the Call
block had multiple calls). This block has no body.<br>

separately-loadable parts. With this block, you are able to select one of the
parts and the utility/emulator will start loading from that block. For
example you can use it when the game has a separate Trainer or when it is a
multiload. Of course, to make some use of it the emulator/utility has to show
a menu with the selections when it encounters such a block. All offsets are
relative signed words.<br>

starts, where to rewind to when the game ends, etc. This description is not
guaranteed to be shown while the tape is playing, but can be read while
browsing the tape or changing the tape pointer.<br>
The description can be up to 255 characters long but please keep it down to
about 30 so the programs can show it in one line (where this is appropriate).<br>

This feature is (theoretically) the main advantage of the TZX format over the

this feature. So, for that matter, one could as well keep using normal TAP

so that you can easily copy the files together and use them. Of course, this
means that resulting file would be 10 bytes longer than if this block was not
used. If you can avoid using this block for this purpose, then do so; it is
preferable to use a utility to join the two files and ensure that they are
both of the higher version number.<br>

begin with a 32bit Block length entry in the first 4 bytes; the length value
should exclude that first 4 bytes). With that definition, decoders may skip
unknown blocks - and may still work (if the blocks contain only comments or
so).<br>
A special case are the C64 blocks (ID 16h and ID 17h) where the TZX format
does "clearly" define BOTH to include AND to exclude first 4 bytes in the
length entry (that blocks should never show up in Spectrum files, so it
should be no problem, as far as I know they even weren't ever actually used
for the C64).<br>

have to the TZX maintainers so that they can be included.<br>

for the ZX Spectrum and complies with the following:<br>

  - runs on, but doesn't use any of the special hardware of ZX Spectrum 128K
  - doesn't run on ZX Spectrum 16K
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>If, for example, game works on BOTH ZX 48K and 128K, and uses the hardware of
the 128K Spectrum, then you would just include the 128K Spectrum in the list
(because by default it has to work on 48K too).<br>
If the game is 128K ONLY then you would include two entries: The game works
on AND uses the hardware of a 128K Spectrum AND the game DOESN'T work on a
48K Spectrum.<br>
If the game works on both 48K and 128K Spectrum, but it only uses the sound
chip (AY) of the 128K Spectrum and none of its extra memory then you would
only include the entry that says that the game uses the 'Classic AY hardware
(Spectrum 128 compatible sound device)'.<br>

<b>ZX80/ZX81 Filetype Detection</b><br>
ZX80/ZX81 files SHOULD have a Hardware Info block (ID 33h) that identifies
them as ZX80/ZX81 file. Unfortunately, in practice, they usually do NOT
contain that information. So, to detect a ZX80/ZX81 file, one would need to
check if the first data block has ID 19h, and if so, if it contains the above
Symbols. To separate between ZX80 and ZX81 one may need to examine the
presence of the ZX81 filename, and the values in the System Area.<br>
<br>
<b>ZX80/ZX81 Leading Silence</b><br>
ZX80/ZX81 files are preceeded by leading silence (instead of a pilot tone).
For the ZX80 this leading silence is REQUIRED (must be at least around
500ms). For ZX81, it can be shorter, and it is required only if the signal is
preceeded by noise (if loading starts at the exact time when the 1st pulse is
output, then the ZX81 BIOS doesn't need the silence).<br>
The ID 19h block itself doesn't support leading silence, so ZX80 files MUST
have it preceeded by Pause block (ID 20h) - one could almost expect that
people will violate that rule, if so, software must automatically insert the
leading pause.<br>

feature. You can specify the point at which to insert the POKEs in the

is either encrypted (like with the 'Speedlock' or 'Alkatraz' loaders) or it
is corrupted by some on-screen info (like the 'Bleepload' loader). Of course
not only loading screens can be stored here... you can use it to store maps
or any other picture that is in Spectrum Video format (that's why the
Description is there for), but because the Loading Screen will be the most
common you can just set the description length field to 0 when you use it for
that. Also the border colour can be specified.<br>

can contain text, graphics (with Spectrum attributes), different type faces,

Format revision: v1.20, 19 Dec 2006<br>
<br>
<b>Introduction</b><br>
TZX is a file format designed to preserve all (hopefully) of the tapes with
turbo or custom loading routines. Even though some of the newer and 'smarter'
emulators can find most of the info about the loader from the code itself,
this isn't possible if you want to save the file to tape, or to a real
Spectrum. And with all this information in the file, the emulators don't have
to bother with finding out the timings and other things.<br>
This file format is explicitly targeted to the ZX Spectrum compatible
computers only. Specialized versions of the TZX format have been defined for
other machines too, e.g. the Amstrad CPC and C64, but they are now available
as distinct file formats with other filename extensions.<br>
At the end of this document you can find a description of encoding
differences between these machines and a table which displays timings used by
their respective BIOS loading routines (some of them are not official). If
you know of any other machines that have similar encoding that could be
represented with this file format then let us know.<br>
<br>
If you're looking for TZX files, you can find an extensive collection at
Martijn van der Heide's 'World of Spectrum'.<br>
<br>
The format was first started off by Tomaz Kac who was maintainer until
revision 1.13, and then passed to Martijn v.d. Heide. After that, Ramsoft
were the maintainers for a brief period during which the v1.20 revision was
put together. If you have any questions about the format, visit the forums at
World of Spectrum and ask.<br>
<br>
The default format file extension is "TZX" and hopefully this won't have to
change in the future; for RISC OS, the current TAP file type will be used.
Amstrad CPC files should use the extension "CDT" to distinguish them from the
ZX Spectrum files, otherwise the inner structure is totally the same.<br>
<br>
<b>Rules and definitions</b><br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  - All values are stored in little endian format (i.e. LSB first)
  - All unused bits should be set to zero
  - All timings are given in 3.5MHz clock cycles (unless otherwise stated)
  - All ASCII texts use the ISO 8859-1 (Latin 1) encoding
  - Some ASCII texts can have several lines, to be separated by chr(0Dh)
  - MSB = most significant byte, LSB = least significant byte
  - MSb = most significant bit, LSb = least significant bit
  - The values in curly brackets {} are the default values as used by BIOS
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
<b>High and low levels</b><br>
This document refers to 'high' and 'low' pulse levels. Whether this is
implemented as ear=1 and ear=0 respectively or the other way around is not
important, as long as it is done consistently.<br>
Zeros and ones in 'Direct recording' blocks mean low and high pulse levels
respectively. The 'current pulse level' after playing a Direct Recording
block of CSW recording block is the last level played.<br>
The 'current pulse level' after playing the blocks ID 10h,11h,12h,13h,14h or
19h is the opposite of the last pulse level played, so that a subsequent
pulse will produce an edge.<br>
An emulator should put the 'current pulse level' to 'low' when starting to
play a TZX file, either from the start or from a certain position. The writer
of a TZX file should ensure that the 'current pulse level' is well-defined in
every sequence of blocks where this is important, i.e. in any sequence that
includes a 'Direct recording' block, or that depends on edges generated by
'Pause' blocks. The recommended way of doing this is to include a Pause after
each sequence of blocks.<br>
<br>
<b>Silence (pause, stop, end of tzx file)</b><br>
Some blocks allow to define a pause of N milliseconds (ms) duration. If the
old level was low, then the first 1 ms of that pause should be high (required
to terminate the last pulse), and the remaining N-1 ms should be low. If the
old level was high, then the full N ms should be low.<br>
The same requirement applies also when stopping the tape (on stop command, or
at end of tzx file): if the old level was low, then output 1ms high before
stopping the motor (required because some files do not include a pause after
the last data block which would imply the 1ms thing)<br>
Pause of 0 ms duration is completely ignored, so the 'current pulse level'
will NOT change in this case. If there is no pause between two data blocks
then the second one should follow immediately; not even so much as one T
state between them.<br>
<br>
<b>Machine specific information</b><br>
Currently supported machines are: ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, SAM Coupe, ZX-81
Jupiter ACE and Enterprise. Only ZX-81 (or the old Timex 1000) and Jupiter
ACE use different tape encoding than the others.<br>
<br>
<b>Jupiter ACE encoding</b><br>
See a dedicated site.<br>
<br>
<b>ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, SAM Coupe &amp; Enterprise tape encoding</b><br>
These computers share the same tape encoding, which is normal frequency type
encoding. Each bit is represented by one 'wave' of different duration for bit
0 and bit 1. Normally bit 1 is twice as big as bit 0. In the blocks, the
timings are presented with Z80 T-states (cycles) per pulse. One wave is made
from two pulses.<br>
The standard data blocks have always the same structure: first there is the
PILOT tone, then the two SYNC pulses (one wave) and after that the actual
DATA (which can include a FLAG byte at the beginning and a CHECKSUM byte at
the end).<br>
Here is a table showing the pulse timings for each part of the standard BIOS
load/save routine for each of these machines. If you have more accurate
information then we would be glad to include it here. Enterprise has two
loading speeds so timings for both are included.<br>

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>Notes:<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  (1)  The Spectrum uses different pilot lengths for header and data blocks.
       Header blocks have 8063 and data blocks have 3223 pilot pulses.
  (2)  Amstrad CPC BIOS load/save routine can use variable speed for loading,
       so the bit 1 pulse must be read from the pilot tone and bit 0 can be
       read from the sync pulses, and is always half the size of bit 1. The
       checksum is also different than the other two machines. The speed can
       vary from 1000 to 2000 baud.
  (*)  The SAM Coupe' timings can be user selected by a system variable. The
       standard value is 112, which is VERY close to ZX Spectrum loading
       speed, and therefore the 'Standard Speed Data' block can be used for
       those blocks. However if this system variable is changed then the
       timings will change accordingly. In the above table the value of this
       variable is given as 'W', the 'H' value is 'W/2'. Of course the best
       way to determine it is to calculate it from the timings you get when
       sampling the Pilot tone. The values in the table could be by a
       fraction of the real ones, but it should not matter. Note: All timings
       are written in 3.5MHz clock. Also, there might be some junk bits
       (usually 7 or 8) AFTER the checksum (XOR) byte at the end of the
       block, but they can just be ignored.
  (**) The Enterprise stores data in a different way than all other computers
       do. It stores the LSb first, but the data blocks require the data to
       be MSb first. This might lead to some confusion, but if the same
       mechanism is used to replay data for all machines then there will be
       no problem. Just store the data as MSb first, but if you want to view
       the raw data in the TZX file then you will have to mirror each byte to
       get the correct values.
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>IMPORTANT: The ZXTape format has ALL timings written according to a 3.5MHz
clock (the standard Spectrum 16/48K clock), so if the tape should be used on
an Amstrad CPC with 4MHz clock then you should multiply ALL timings with
4/3.5 when you use that tape (this should be trivial). Similarly goes for SAM
Coupe, that uses a 6MHz clock and Jupiter ACE that uses 3.2448 MHz and
Enterprise that uses 4 MHz!<br>

The Data Register (Port 3FFDh) is used to write Commands and Parameters, to

are called Command-, Execution-, and Result-Phase. The Main Status Register
signalizes when the FDC is ready to send/receive the next byte through the

<br>
<b>Command Phase</b><br>
A command consists of a command byte (eventually including the MF, MK, SK
bits), and up to eight parameter bytes.<br>
<br>
<b>Execution Phase</b><br>
During this phase, the actual data is transferred (if any). Usually that are
the data bytes for the read/written sector(s), except for the Format Track
Command, in that case four bytes for each sector are transferred.<br>
<br>
<b>Result Phase</b><br>
Returns up to seven result bytes (depending on the command) that are
containing status information. The Recalibrate and Seek Track commands do not
return result bytes directly, instead the program must wait until the Main
Status Register signalizes that the command has been completed, and then it
must (!) send a Sense Interrupt State command to 'terminate' the
Seek/Recalibrate command.<br>

<b>Motor On/Off Flipflop</b><br>
The motor is controlled via a bit in Port 1FFDh (see ULA chapter), the bit
controls motors for ALL drive(s), it is not possible to turn on/off the motor
of a specific drive separately.<br>
<br>
<b>Notes:</b><br>
Before accessing a disk you should first Recalibrate the drive, that'll move
the head backwards until it reaches Track 0 (that's required to initialize
the FDCs track counter). On a 80 track drive you may need to repeat that in
case that the first recalibration attempt wasn't successful (that's because
the FDC stops searching after 77 steps).<br>
<br>
Now if you want to format, read or write a sector on a specific track you
must first Seek that track (command 0Fh). That'll move the read/write head to
the physical track number. If you don't do that, then the FDC will attempt to
read/write data to/from the current physical track, independendly of the
specified logical Track-ID.<br>
<br>
The Track-, Sector-, and Head-IDs are logical IDs only. These logical IDs are
defined when formatting the disk, and aren't required to be identical to the
physical Track, Sector, or Head numbers. However, when reading or writing a
sector you must specify the same IDs that have been used during formatting.<br>
<br>
Despite of the confusing name, a sector with a "Deleted Data Address Mark"
(DAM) is not deleted. The DAM-flag is just another ID-bit, and (if that
ID-bit is specified correctly in the command) it can be read/written like
normal data sectors.<br>
<br>
At the end of a successful read/write command, the program should send a
Terminal Count (TC) signal to the FDC. However, in the CPC (and probably also
in the Spectrum) the TC pin isn't connected to the I/O bus, making it
impossible for the program to confirm a correct operation. For that reason,
the FDC will assume that the command has failed, and it'll return both Bit 6
in Status Register 0 and Bit 7 in Status Register 1 set. The program should
ignore this errormessage.<br>
<br>
The CPC doesn't support floppy DMA transfers, and the FDCs Interrupt signal
isn't used in the CPC also.<br>
<br>
Usually single sided 40 Track 3" disk drives are used in CPCs, whereas 40
tracks is the official specification, practically 42 tracks could be used.
The FDC controller can be used to control 80 tracks, and/or double sided
drives also, even though AMSDOS isn't supporting such formats. AMSDOS is
supporting a maximum of two disk drives only.<br>

<b>Features</b><br>
The Interface is quite simple, it consists of the TRDOS ROM, the FDC chip,
and eventually a Magic button and/or Reset button. It doesn't include RAM,
nor any extras like Centronics or Joystick ports.<br>
Since there's no built-in RAM, it allocates 70h bytes at 5CB6h (or at higher
address if other hardware like Interface 1 has already allocated memory).
Additionally, it does temporarily allocate a 100h bytes as sector buffer
while accessing the disk.<br>

enters TRDOS instead of BASIC on power-up. Unknown which opcode address
activates TRDOS... probably 0000h.<br>
The Auto-Boot feature works only on Spectrum 48K/Plus, but isn't compatible
with the Spectrum 128 (the Beta 128 includes a "system switch" that allows to
disable auto-boot for Spectrum 128 compatibility, ie. on the Spectrum 128
TRDOS can be started only manually via RANDOMIZE USR 15616).<br>
<br>
<b>MEM:0066h? - Enable ROM &amp; I/O Ports (BetaPlus/TRDOSv4 and Beta128/TRDOSv5.0x)</b><br>
The Beta Plus and Beta 128 have a Magic button, presumably triggering an /NMI
and thus needing to enable ROM on address 0066h (?) although in poor quality
schematics it looks more like /RESET than /NMI. The button does usually allow
to save snapshots (except, on the Scorpion, it launches a Service-Monitor
program).<br>
<br>
<b>I/O Port Activation</b><br>
Below I/O ports are enabled only while the ROM is enabled, too. Ie. when
disabled, there's no conflict with Kempston Joysticks (Port 1Fh) or with the
VRAM Garbage effect (Port FFh). Mind that ROM and I/O ports are automatically
disabled when accessing opcodes at 4000h..FFFFh (so the I/O ports can be
accessed ONLY from inside of the TRDOS ROM).<br>

<b>Command description</b><br>
Commands should only be loaded in the Command Register when the Busy status
bit is off (Status bit 0). The one exception is the Force Interrupt command.
Whenever a command is being executed, the Busy status bit is set.<br>
At the completion of every command an INTRQ is generated. INTRQ is reset by
either reading the status register or by loading the command register with a
new command. In addition, INTRQ is generated if a Force Interrupt command
condition is met.<br>
When a command is completed, an interrupt is generated and the busy status
bit is reset. The Status Register indicates whether the completed command
encountered an error or was fault free.<br>

<b>Type I commands (Restore, Seek, Step-Out, Step-In, Step)</b><br>
Used to move the read/write head. The stepping motor rate should be usally
set to 6ms (r1 and r0 bits set to zero) for a 3.5-inch floppy disk drive. An
optional verification of head position can be performed by setting bit 2
(V=1) in the command word.<br>
<br>
When V=1: When the seek is completed, the drive automatically goes into read
mode, the track number from the first encountered Sector ID Field is then
compared against the contents of the Track Register (or Data Register?), if
the track numbers compare (and the ID Field CRC is correct) the verify
operation is complete and an INTRQ is generated with no errors. If these
track numbers do not match, the Seek Error bit of the status register is set.<br>
<br>
When V=0: When the seek is completed, the track position is not verified
(this mode is required for unformatted disks). The command ends once the last
step pulse is output. Since the result is that there is not enough time for
step stability, the host system must use its software to make the floppy disk
wait a certain period before reading or writing the track just arrived at.<br>
<br>
When the seek command is complete, the interrupt request is set and at the
same time, the Busy bit in the status register is set to 0. When the CPU
reads the status register, it resets the interrupt request signal.<br>
<br>
<b>Restore (Seek Track 0)</b><br>
If TR00 is not active, stepping pulses are issued until the TR00 input
is activated. The Track Register is set to zero, and an interrupt is
generated when track 0 has been reached.<br>
<br>
<b>Seek</b><br>
This command assumes that the Track Register contains the &lt;current&gt; position
of the head, and that the Data Register contains the &lt;desired&gt; destination
track number. The FD179X will update the Track Register and issue stepping
pulses in the appropriate direction until the contents of the Track and Data
Register are equal to each other. An interrupt is generated at the completion
of the command.<br>
<br>
<b>Step-Out, Step-In, Step</b><br>
Issues one stepping pulse to the disk drive. Step-Out: towards track 0.
Step-In: towards track 76 (that feature is not useful for 80-track drives).
Step: same direction as for previous step command. The track register is
updated (ie. incremented or decremented) only if the "T" bit has been set in
the command word. An interrupt is generated at the end of each command.<br>
<br>
<b>Type II commands (Read Sector, Write Sector)</b><br>
Prior to loading the Type II command into the Command Register, the
computer must load the Sector Register with the desired sector number.
Upon receipt of the Type II command, the busy status bit is set. The
FD179X must find an ID field with a matching Track number and Sector
number, otherwise the Record not found status bit is set and the command
is terminated with an interrupt.<br>
Each of the Type II commands contains an m flag which determines if
multiple records (sectors) are to be read or written. If m=0, a single
sector is read or written and an interrupt is generated at the
completion of the command. If m=1, multiple records are read or written
with the sector register internally updated so that an address
verification can occur on the next record. The FD179X will continue to
read or write multiple records and update the sector register in
numerical ascending sequence until the sector register exceeds the
number of sectors on the track or until the Force Interrupt command is
loaded into the Command Register.<br>
The Type II commands for 1791-94 also contain side select compare flags.
When C=0 (bit 1), no comparison is made. When C=1, the LSB of the side
number is read off the ID Field of the disk and compared with the
contents of the S flag.<br>
<br>
<b>Read Sector</b><br>
Upon receipt of the command, the head is loaded, the busy status bit set
and when an ID field is encountered that has the correct track number,
correct sector number, correct side number, and correct CRC, the data
field is presented to the computer.<br>
An DRQ is generated each time when the CPU must read a byte from the
data register, the Lost Data bit is set if the CPU didn't read data in
time, and the Read operation continues until the end of sector is
reached.<br>
At the end of the Read operation, the type of Data Address Mark
encountered in the data field is recorded in the Status Register (bit
5).<br>
<br>
<b>Write Sector</b><br>
Upon receipt of the command, the head is loaded, the busy status bit set
and when an ID field is encountered that has the correct track number,
correct sector number, correct side number, and correct CRC, a DRQ is
generated.<br>
The FD179X counts off 22 bytes (in double density) from the CRC field
and the Write Gate output is made active if the DRQ is serviced (ie. the
DR has been loaded by the computer). If DRQ has not been serviced, the
command is terminated and the Lost Data status bit is set. If the DRQ
has been serviced, 12 bytes of zeroes (in double density) are written to
the disk, then the Data Address Mark as determined by the a0 field of
the command.<br>
The FD179X then writes the data field and generates DRQ's to the
computer. If the DRQ is not serviced in time for continuous writing the
Lost Data Status bit is set and a byte of zeroes is written on the disk
and the command continues until the last byte of the sector is reached.<br>
After the last data byte has been written on the disk, the two-byte CRC
is computed internally and written on the disk followed by one byte of
logic ones.<br>
<br>
<b>Type III commands</b><br>
<br>
<b>Read Address</b><br>
Upon receipt of the Read Address command, the head is loaded and the
Busy Status bit is set. The next encountered ID field is then read in
from the disk, and the six data bytes of the ID field are assembled and
transferred to the DR, and a DRQ is generated for each byte. The six
bytes of the ID field are : Track address, Side number, Sector address,
Sector Length, CRC1, CRC2. Although the CRC bytes are transferred to the
computer, the FD179X checks for validity and the CRC error status bit is
set if there is a CRC error. The track address of the ID field is
written into the sector register so that a comparison can be made by the
user. At the end of the operation, an interrupt is generated and the
Busy status bit is reset.<br>
<br>
<b>Read Track</b><br>
Upon receipt of the Read Track command, the head is loaded, and the busy
status bit is set. Reading starts with the leading edge of the first
encountered index pulse and continues until the next index pulse. All
gap, header, and data bytes are assembled and transferred to the data
register and DRQ's are generated for each byte. The accumulation of
bytes is synchronized to each address mark encountered. An interrupt is
generated at the completion of the command. The ID Address Mark, ID
field, ID CRC bytes, DAM, Data and Data CRC bytes for each sector will
be correct. The gap bytes may be read incorrectly during write-splice
time because of synchronization.<br>
<br>
<b>Write Track (formatting a track)</b><br>
Upon receipt of the Write Track command, the head is loaded and the Busy
Status bit is set. Writing starts with the leading edge of the first
encountered index pulse and continues until the next index pulse, at
which time the interrupt is activated. The Data Request is activated
immediately upon receiving the command, but writing will not start until
after the first byte has been loaded into the DR. If the DR has not been
loaded by the time the index pulse is encountered, the operation is
terminated making the device Not Busy, the Lost Data status bit is set,
and the interrupt is activated. If a byte is not present in the DR when
needed, a byte of zeroes is substituted. This sequence continues from
one index mark to the next index mark.<br>
Normally, whatever data pattern appears in the data register is written
on the disk with a normal clock pattern. However, if the FD179X detects
a data pattern of F5 thru FE in the data register, this is interpreted
as data address marks with missing clocks or CRC generation. The CRC
generator is initialized when an F5 data byte is about to be transferred
(in MFM). An F7 pattern will generate two CRC bytes. As a consequence,
the patterns F5 thru FE must not appear in the gaps, data fiels, or ID
fiels. Tracks may be formatted with sector lengths of 128, 256, 512 or
1024 bytes. See "Formatting" below for more info and example.<br>
<br>
<b>Type IV command (Force Interrupt)</b><br>
The Forced Interrupt command is generally used to terminate a multiple
sector read or write command or insure Type I status register. This
command can be loaded into the command register at any time. If there is
a current command under execution (busy status bit set), the command
will be terminated and the busy status bit reset.<br>
<br>
<b>Status Register</b><br>
Upon receipt of any command, except the Force Interrupt command, the
Busy Status bit is set and the rest of the status bits are updated or
cleared for the new command.<br>
The user has the option of reading the status register through program
control or using the DRQ line with DMA or interrupt methods. When the DR
is read the DRQ bit in the Status register and the DRQ line are
automatically reset. A write to the DR also causes both DRQ's to reset.
The busy bit in the status may be monitored with a user program to
determine when a command is complete, in lieu of using the INTRQ line.
When using the INTRQ, a busy status check is not recommended because a
read of the status register to determine the condition of busy will
reset the INTRQ line.<br>

<b>Status for type IV command</b><br>

execution, the Busy status bit is reset and the rest of the status bits

If the Force Interrupt command is received when there is no command
under execution, the Busy Status bit is reset and the rest of the status
bits are updated or cleared. In this case, Status reflects the Type I
commands.<br>
<br>
<b>External Circuit</b><br>
The floppy disk controller itself cannot select the drive number, side,
disk density, and it cannot turn on/off the drive motor(s). These
settings must be set up by an external circuit, which are (as far as
they aren't set to a fixed setting) controlled through separate I/O
addresses. For details have a look at the MSX FDC I/O addresses.<br>
<br>
Note that the FDC contains only one track register which is used for all
drives. The current track position for each drive should be backed up in
memory, and the track register should be updated each time when changing
the current drive number.<br>
<br>
The external circuit might also use the INTRQ and DRQ lines to handle
FDC operations by DMA transfers, and/or to produce interrupts upon
completion. In the MSX these methods are not used, however, most MSX
adapters allow to read out the state of INTRQ and DRQ from a custom I/O
address (this isn't actually required because INTRQ is just a inverted
copy of the Status Busy bit, and DRQ can be read out from the normal
Status register either.<br>

<b>Sinclair: Microdrive (endless tape drive)</b><br>
<b>Rotronics Wafadrive (endless tape drive) (not Microdrive compatible)</b><br>
These are tape-drives, so, obviously, they don't use standard floppy disk
controllers.<br>
Unlike normal cassette recorders, these drives can seek files (or free space)
automatically (without needing to press any play/stop/forward buttons), ie.
they do have a disk-like filesystem, however, they must wind the tape until
it reaches the desired location, so the seek-time is relative slow. Wafadrive
cartridges are manufactured with 16K, 64K, 128K capacity (of which 16K has
the shortest tape, and therefore fastest seek-time).<br>

<b>Crescent Quick Disk (2.8" disk, with single spiral-track, 128K or 256K)</b><br>
<b>Triton Quick Disk (2.8" disk, with single spiral-track, 100K)</b><br>
Quick Disks (also used by Nintendo's Famicom Disk System) have only a single
spiral-shaped track (like CDROMs and music records), so, obviously, they
don't use standard floppy disk controllers.<br>
Note: Quick Disk drives don't have a stepping motor for random access,
instead the head is following the spiral windings in sequential access
fashion (giving it a relative slow seek-time; similar to endless tape
drives).<br>
<br>
<b>Timex FDD and FDD-3000</b><br>
These drives are using standard a Western Digital controller, but, the
controller is connected to a separate Z80 CPU. So the spectrum is
communicating with that external Z80 CPU rather than directly with the WD
chip.<br>
<br>
<b>Logitek: Disc Interface (connect a Commodore 1541 drive to spectrum)</b><br>
An adaptor for communicating with Commodore 1541 drive (the standard disk
drive for the C64) via serial data cable. The 1541 doesn't contain any
standard disk controller (it consists of a 6502 CPU and a bunch of TTL
logic). Although the drive uses standard 5.25" disks, the sector encoding
isn't compatible with that used by Western Digital WD177x and NEC uPD765 disk

<br>
<b>Spectrum CD Games Pack (Code Masters) (1989)</b><br>
The pack consists of a Audio CD with about 30 spectrum games (each one

adapter) stereo headphone socket to spectrum 9pin DSUB joystick port) (for
Spectrum 128/+2/+3 or 48K with Kempston interface), and loading software on
tape, once when a game is loaded one can press Q,U,I,T on keyboard to load a
new game (without needing to load tape loader again).<br>
No info if/how the stereo signal is used (maybe one channel used as CLOCK,
and the other channel as DATA...?) The cable does reportedly contain a 1bit
A/D converter, which is probably a single transistor or so (so it's mono, not
stereo?). The CD capacity is said to be "12 Megs" (presumably meaning 12
Megabit = 60 tracks with 25Kbytes each).<br>
<br>
<b>Unknown Controllers</b><br>
For most spectrum disk interfaces it is still unknown if they do contain a
standard disk controller chip, and if so, which one (the WD177x chips seem to
be quite popular in the spectrum world, so many of the unknown interfaces are
probably using that chips, too).<br>

the Currah uSpeech).<br>
To wait for an interrupt, one can use the HALT opcode, and/or check if the
FRAMES system variable has changed.<br>
<br>
<b>IRQ (IM2)</b><br>
This mode allows to use a custom IRQ handler at [I*100h+databus]. Because of
the Display Snow bug, the table may not be at 4000h..7FFFh.<br>
Normally [I*100h+databus] would be table in RAM at 8000h..FFFFh, however,
some games have it in ROM: Spectrum 48K has [3B00h..3C00h]=FFh, and Spectrum
128 and up have [3BFFh..3C00h]=FFh filled, the handler is then at FFFFh,
which would be usually set to 18h (a JR opcode) whose parameter byte is read
from address 0000h in BIOS, which is F3h (a DI opcode), thus forming a JR
FFF4h opcode.<br>
Assuming that the databus contains a "random" number in range of 00h..FFh
upon IRQs, it requires a table with 101h bytes at [I*100h+0..100h]. On the
Spectrum 128 and up the databus seems to be stable FFh, needing only a 2
bytes at [I*100h+FFh..100h].<br>
<br>
<b>External IRQ</b><br>
The /IRQ signal is available on the expansion port, eventually allowing
external hardware to sense when vblanks occur, or allowing external hardware
to inject additional IRQs (done by the AMX Mouse in IM2), though it's
problematic to distingush external IRQs from normal vblank IRQs, especially
if they occur simultaneously.<br>
<br>
<b>External NMI</b><br>
The NMI handler is at 0066h in BIOS. On the Spectrum 16K/48K/+/128/+2, and on
Timex TC2048/TC2068/TS2068, the BIOS handler does (accidently) do this:<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  IF [5CB0h]=0000h then JMP [5CB0h]    ;ie. jump to 0000h (bullshit)
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>On the Spectrum +2A/+3, the bug was fixed, and it does:<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  IF [5CB0h]&lt;&gt;0000h then JMP [5CB0h]
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>A couple of disk-interfaces are hooking address 0066h (or address 0000h,
which can be easier decoded and which works too, due to the bug, except in
the bug-fixed Spectrum +2A/+3 versions), the most common use is a Snapshot
function, allowing to load/save the entire RAM to/from disk (useful because
most spectrum programs support only cassette loading/saving). Some disk
interfaces are using NMI to handle data requests (not so useful as that could
be also done without NMIs).<br>

<b>Kempston Port Notes</b><br>
This is a quite popular standard, and should be supported by most games.
There are a lot of homebrew clones, including some released in magazines,
many variants are decoding only A5=0, ignoring A6 and A7. Some variants are
using the upper data bits (D5-D7) as centronics busy input, or as floppy
interrupt or data requests.<br>
<br>
<b>Sinclair Port Notes</b><br>
Sinclair ports are supported by the Interface 2 adaptor, by the Disciple disk
interface, and are built-in in Spectrum +2/+3. The Sinclair joysticks are
equivalent to keyboard keys 1,2,3,4,5 (port2) and 6,7,8,9,0 (port1), both
keyboard groups are arranged as L,R,D,U,F (that keyboard arrangement is why
the data bits are in opposite order for port1 and port2) (note: the
arrangement does NOT comply with the cursor keys on keys 5,6,7,8). Reading
both ports at once doesn't work well: Interface 2 doesn't respond to reads
from Port E7FEh, Spectrum +2/+3 does respond to it (but, due to the reversed
data bit arrangement, it returns rather useless garbage, eg. Up1 ANDed with
Fire2).<br>
<br>
<b>Protek Port Notes</b><br>
The original Protek supports only cursor mode, newer variants can be
reportedly switched to three modes (probably cursor, kempston, and sinclair
or so).<br>
AGF and Thurnall support Cursor+Rubout, too. AGF additionally supports
T-Y-U-I-P as second joystick. Thurnall additionally supports Q-A-Z-X for
whatever usage.<br>
<br>
<b>Timex TS2068/TC2068 Port Notes</b><br>
Timex Ports are using PSG register 14, which must be configured properly:
Clear Bit6 of PSG Register 7 (input direction), write FFh or 8Fh or so to PSG
register 14 (output HIGH levels), and set PSG index to 14. For details see
PSG/sound specs.<br>
<br>
<b>Rotronics Wafadrive Joystick Adaptor</b><br>
According to the Rotronics Wafadrive manual, one can connect a joystick to
the centronics port of the Wafadrive via an adaptor. There's no info on how
to build that adaptor, but the manual says it is sold separately (if that
adaptor was actually ever produced, then it didn't became very popular).
Because the Wafadrive centronics port is one-directonal, it is probably using
the joystick switches in reversed direction (ie. outputting LOW levels to
L,R,U,D,F via some of the Data lines, and reading the result from the common
pin via the Busy input).<br>
<br>
<b>Joystick Port Pin-outs</b><br>
The five switches are connected to Pin8 as a common pin, in the Atari
standard that'd be GND, but in some variants it is a /SELECT signal that goes
low when reading from the joystick port (that method works with joystick that
consists of raw switches; but won't work with sticks that contain autofire
functions or other logic that requires +5V/GND supply at Pin7/Pin8).<br>

<br>
<b>AMX Mouse (IM2 interrupts)</b><br>
This is almost as powerful as the Kempston Mouse, but conflicts with various
other hardware expansions, the AMX Mouse is rarely supported by any programs.<br>
<a href="http://nocash.emubase.de/zxdocs.htm#spectrummouseamxmouseadvancedmemorysystems">Spectrum Mouse - AMX Mouse (Advanced Memory Systems)</a><br>
The I/O addresses conflict with various other expansions like Kempston
Joysticks (Port 1Fh), Beta Disk, Fuller Box, etc.<br>
<br>
<b>Amiga/Atari Mice (software counters)</b><br>
Amiga/Atari mice can be connected directly to Kempston Joystick ports (which
have +5V and GND), without needing any mouse interface. Although it's simple
at hardware side, it's supported only by a dozen of programs.<br>
<a href="http://nocash.emubase.de/zxdocs.htm#spectrummouseamigamouseoratarimouseinkempstonjoystickport">Spectrum Mouse - Amiga Mouse or Atari Mouse in Kempston Joystick port</a><br>
The problem is that the mickeys must be counted by software, meaning that the
software must check Port 1Fh more than 500 times per second, ie. much more
often than it could be done via the 50Hz vblank interrupt.<br>

could be mapped to bit1-2 of the Z80PIO data ports; maybe the whole 8bit data
ports are latched on interrupts; which would freeze the state of bit1-2.<br>
<br>
<b>Interrupts</b><br>
The AMX mouse triggers an interrupt and outputs an IM2 interrupt vector on
the databus on each mickey, the CPU should be in IM2, and the CPUs I-register
should contain MSB of the interrupt table, the Z80 does then do am indirect
"CALL [I*100h+databus]" on interrupts. Mind that trying to set I=40h..7Fh
results in ULA Snow bug.<br>
The two Z80PIO interrupt vectors should point to the address of X and Y
motion handler; which should read the X or Y direction bit, and
inrease/decrease the mickey counter accordingly. If both X and Y mickeys
occor simultaneously, then the Z80PIO would first produce vector A, and then
vector B (after vector A was processed).<br>
The normal Vblank interrupt doesn't output anything on databus, so databus
should be (hopefully) FFh, causing a "CALL [I*100h+FFh]" on vblank. If
mickeys occur simulaneously with vblank, then the vblank interrupt is
probably lost...? which would be bad for general animation synchronizations,
keyboard handling, as well as for mouse specific threshold calculations.<br>
<br>
<b>Notes</b><br>
The Z80PIO is reset on power-up (when raising VCC) only, but NOT on /RESET.<br>
The AMX Mouse is supported by Minesweeper (new version - EN), and Artist II.<br>

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>As shown in 1st/2nd column, Amiga and Atari have XA/XB/YA/YB arranged
differently. 3rd column shows how the signals are mapped on the joystick
port. The 4th column is just for curiosity, it shows the connection between
Kempston Mouse and Kempston Mouse Interface (aside from the different pinouts
it's much the same as Amiga/Atari mice, the big difference is that the
Kempston Mouse Interface contains hardware counters, without needing to count
mickeys by software).<br>
<br>
<b>Motion Signals</b><br>
The XA/XB indicate horizontal motion (and YA/YB vertical motion), like so:<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>      One Direction            Opposite Direction
  XA  _______----____          _____----______
  XB  _____----______          _______----____
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>The signal timings depend on how fast the mouse is moved (ie. if the mouse is
not moved, then it may stop anywhere in the above diagram, eg. while XA and
XB are both high, both low, or one high and one low).<br>
The simpliest approach is to wait for raising edge on XA, and then to check
XB (either XB is already high, or XB is still low) and increase/decrease the
software's mickey counter accordingly. In situations where the direction
changes, it may be also recommended to handle "half mickeys" on falling edges
on XA, eg.:<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>      One Direction    Stop    Opposite Direction
  XA  _______---------------------------______
  XB  _____-------------------------------____
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>In the above case, checking only raising XA would miss the direction change
on falling XA (if that happens repeatedly, then the mouse would disappear
towards the screen border, eg. if the mouse is in an unstable position,
without actually being moved).<br>
<br>
<b>Notes</b><br>
Mind that the Kempston Joystick port inverts all signals (that is don't care
for XA,XB,YA,XB, but the button bit may be opposite as expected). And, of
course, a Kempston Joystick port does have only one Fire button (so only the
Left mouse button can be read).<br>

<b>Datel Genius Mouse</b><br>
Early Datel mice (April-March 1987) had 3 buttons, all later mice had only 2
buttons. Very late Datel mouse interfaces (1989 or so) additionally included
a kempston joystick port. The interface (at least the latest version)
contains only a single 28pin SMD chip, plus some resistors and capacitors.<br>
The used I/O addresses are still unknown, however, the interface with the SMD
chip connects to D0-D7, /IORQ, A5, A8-A10, +5V, and GND... so it might be
simply a clone of the Kempston Mouse interface? Although, Kempston Mouse and
Kempston Joystick both use A5=LOW, so, without checking A6/A7, it couldn't
separate between them...?<br>
<br>
<b>Joystick Mouse (supports only fixed speed motion)</b><br>
Some mice (Commodore Mouse 1350, Noris Data Mouse M1, Boeder GEOS-Mouse,
Elite Mouse, Datalux SV-705) emulate a digital joystick. The advantage is
that these mice can be used with any games that support joystick input
(provided that the joystick port outputs +5V and GND pn Pin 7 and 8, ie.
works only with standard Kempston Joystick ports, not with standard Sinclair
Joystick ports). The big disadvantage that these mice can't separate between
slow and fast motion.<br>
<br>
<b>RS232 Mouse on RS232 Port</b><br>
Standard RS232 PC mice can be theoretically connected to Spectrum RS232
ports. In practice it's difficult at both hardware and software side, and so
it's rarely supported. The first problem is that there are at least 16
Spectrum RS232 interfaces from different companies. Next, some Spectrum RS232
ports have non-standard pinouts (eg. Interface 1), simple Spectrum RS232
ports would require to watch the incoming bitstream permanently by software
(eg. Interface 1). So, to execute any other program code, one would need a
RS232 interface with built-in shift register and baudrate timer, and
preferably also an interrupt notification, or, even more preferably a FIFO
that can hold at least 3 characters (so the 1200 baud mouse data would need
to be processed only on vblank interrupts).<br>
<br>
<b>AY-Mouse (C) V.M.G. (schematic in russian ZX Power digital magazine)</b><br>
This is a (rather rarely supported) mouse interface. Similar to the Kempston
Mouse interface it contains two hardware counters and button inputs, intended
to be used with mice that have XA/XB/YA/YB signals (ie. any Amiga, Atari,
AMX, or Kempston mice) (of course, needing to recurse the different pinouts
of that mice).<br>
The interface connects to PSG register 14, with the PSG being accessed via
Port FFFDh and BFFDh, ie. the Spectrum 128 style PSG addresses, but with PSG
register 14 being used to access the mouse (the real Spectrum 128 uses it as
RS232/Keypad port). The PSG register 14 bits are:<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  0-3 In  Horizontal or Vertical 4bit Counter (as selected via bit6)
  4   In  Button 1 (0=Pressed, 1=Released) (presumably Left)

  6   Out Select Counter to be mapped to bit0-3 (?=Horizontal, ?=Vertical)
  7   ?   Border ("for testing, and computer effects, type multicolor")
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>Changing bit6 (raising or falling edge?) does additionally reset the two 4bit
counters to a value of 8 each, so, the difference since last access is new-8
(or 8-new), rather than new-old.<br>

says that one should use the MIC-socket based gun on the Spectrum 128 (dunno
why).<br>
<br>
<b>Magnum Light Phaser for Spectrum 48K (Sinclair/Amstrad/Trojan) (1989)</b><br>
Requires 9V battery, connects to MIC-output socket (which is misused as input
in this case). In the output direction, port FEh should be set to 00h
(accordingly, the 48K games cannot output sound while reading the gun) (mind
that CAS-IN, CAS-OUT, and SOUND-OUT are sharing the same ULA pin).<br>
The trigger button is sensed as LONG pulse (Jungle Warfare reads 8Ch times,
and accepts trigger only if [FEh].Bit6=ZERO on all 8Ch reads). The light
sensor is sensed as EDGE (ie. 0-to-1 or 1-to-0 transitions on [FEh.Bit6]).
Knowing that, it seems that the trigger button and light sensor signals are
XORed with each other.<br>

<b>Note on Defender "sliding autofire/function select switch"</b><br>
Additionally to the trigger button, the Defender guns have a "sliding
autofire/function select switch", reportedly used to select one-shot or
machine-gun mode in some games, however, unknown how this switch is accessed
by software (there seem to be only two data bits used; the light sensor and
trigger button; so maybe it affects the length of the trigger button signal),
also unknown if that switch acts as a push button, sticky switch, or even as
potentiometer?<br>

centronics printers. The only official alternative to the 32-column thing was
to use (rather rare) RS232 printers connected to Interface 1 (see Serial port

<b>Basic Features</b><br>
All cards should have STROBE and BUSY lines, and (at least) 7bit
one-directional DATA lines (most or all have probably 8bit?). Some cards
allow/require to control STROBE manually, others do generate it automatically
after writing to DATA.<br>
<br>
<b>Extended Features</b><br>
A few parallel ports may have bi-directional DATA lines (namely those with
8255 chips) (also some, but not all, ISA parallel cards may have
bi-directional ports). Aside from STROBE and BUSY, some cards may have ACK,
INIT, AUTOLF, etc.<br>

The network interfaces have two mono 3.5mm headphone sockets: One for the
next, and one for the previous computer in the network. Reportedly up to 64
computers can be connected. On the first and last computer one socket is to
be left unconnected (no matter which one) (the sockets contain a switch which
connects the end of the data line via a terminator resistor to ground when no
plug is inserted).<br>
Note: Another (incompatible) network-type is supported by the Opus Discovery
BIOS (which allows to use the Centronics port to transfer files to/from
another computer).<br>

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>The Spectrum/TC20xx port (europe) is compatible only with the signals used by
the ZX81 printer, but not compatible with other ZX80/ZX81 hardware (for some
crazy reason, the /RESET pin is replaced by -12V, giving it a good chance to
vaporize any ZX80/ZX81 hardware). The TS2068 port (usa) is almost fully
backwards compatible with the ZX80/ZX81 and TS1000/TS1500 ports, but
incompatible with Spectrum/TC20xx ports.<br>
On the Spectrum 48K, the /Y,U,V,VIDEO signals are passed through jumpers on
the mainboard, the Y,U,V jumpers are usually installed, but the VID jumper
isn't (so without adding that jumper, VIDEO isn't actually output on
Pin15/Bottom).<br>

<b>TC20xx</b><br>
Although the TC2048/TC2068 are based on the US TS2068, their expansion port
pin-outs were converted back to the 2x28 pin Spectrum layout to match the
european market. During that backwards-conversion the /IORQULA pin got lost,
the TC devrs apparently didn't understand its purpose, in the first version
of the mainboard they have left it unconnected, in the next version it's
accidently connected to /IOREQ via a jumper, in the third version it's
directly wired to /IOREQ without any jumper.<br>
<br>
<b>Later Spectrums</b><br>
Later Spectrums (eg. +3) don't use a +9V power supply, and thus leave the +9V
pin unconnected; also, later models changed the pin numbering from 1..28 to
1..27 (with the SLOT spacings not being counted as pins). Also, the +3 has
Pin4/comp = /ROM1OE, no -5V, no /BUSACK, no /IORQULA, no /ROMCS,
Pin28/comp=RESET, and VIDEO,/Y,V,U replaced by
/ROM2OE,/DISKRD,/DISKWR,/MOTORON.<br>

cartridges manufactured, all of them only 16K in size, using ROM chips with
two /CS pins. For normal EPROMs, /CS1 and /CS2 would need to be ORed by
external logic (although /CS2 aka A15 could be left unconnected when not
using the upper 32K of RAM). Bank switching for more than 16K ROM can be
implemented by reading from a specific memory region, and latching LSBs of
the address as bank number; observe that /MREQ gets low on /RD, /WR, and
/RFSH; during refresh, the IR register pair is output to the address bus, so
the I register should be set to a value that doesn't conflict with the bank
switching addresses.<br>

<b>Timex TS1510 Command Cartridge Player (Pinouts unknown?)</b><br>
An external cartridge adaptor for the TS1500. It can be also used with
TS1000/ZX81 with a 16K RAM upgrade (assuming that most or all cartridges do
require 16K RAM; there were only 4 carts manufactured).<br>
The TS1500 BIOS starts cartridges automatically; it jumps to 2000h if the
first byte at [2000h] is 01h (ie. a LD BC,nnnn opcode). On a ZX81/TS1000, the
cartridge must be manually started (eg. by typing RAND USR 8192). Aside from
the cartridge connector, the TS1510 includes a RESET button.<br>
The first 8K of ROM is obviosly mapped to 2000h. Carts with 16K or more ROM
are mapped to unknown (?) memory locations. According to the manual, such
bigger carts won't work on computers expanded to 32K RAM (which have extra
RAM at 8000h..BFFFh) (so the extra ROM is probably mapped to that region).<br>
The memory mapping logic seems to be built-in in the TS1510 (rather than in
the cartridge), looking at photo found in the internet, it seems to contain a
74LS00 chip, and another chip whose part number is unknown due to bad quality
of the photo.<br>
The TS1510 was advertised to support up to 24K ROM.<br>
Only four TS1510 cartridge titles were ever released:<br>

that the unused inputs are wired to 5V). Pass the reset and keyboard lines
through 1N4148 diodes to prevent them to get stuck. Remove the ROM, and
replace it by a 28pin socket for the EPROM, with 1:1 connection, except for
pin1 (usually NC), and pin27 (usually /RD), omitting the /RD line causes the
EPROM to respond also to writes and refresh, but that should be no problem.<br>

facing in opposite direction). The five joystick data diodes are required
because the joystick cable doesn't contain terminator resistors; without
these diodes, the xboo transmission won't work without the diodes when
signals "bounce back" from the end of the long joystick cable). Without the
A12 diode, the Spectrum game "Zynaps" would crash after 1-2 minutes (no idea
why, there is already a diode on the mainboard, so adding another diode
should have little effect, but it does fix the zynaps crash, maybe it just
works as a resistor).<br>
<br>
<b>Step 3 - Connect AV-Cable</b><br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>        GND ----------------------------------------- Cinch GND

cables don't need to be shielded, but, Cinch GND should be connected
somewhere close to the TV modulator (this gives a better picture).<br>
<br>
<b>Step 4 - Connect Supply from PC</b><br>
There are two simple ways to replace the 9V supply by voltages from a PC
power supply. The straight way would be to use a 7809 to lower 12V to 9V, but
the 7809 produces a lot of heat (and the internal 7805 produces further heat
when it lowers the 9V to 5V). So, my preferred way would be to use 5V:<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>        Spectrum 5V ------------ PC 5V (red floppy cable)
        Spectrum 5V -----||----- Spectrum GND
        Spectrum 5V ----|&gt;|----- Spectrum 9V
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>Inject 5V from the PC supply to 5V on the mainboard (there's no need to
inject GND, since that's passed through the centronics cable). Add a 470uF
capacitor between 5V and GND for better video quality. Pass 5V to 9V via a
1N4001 diode (this feeds the internal +12V/-5V voltage generator which is
usually driven at 9V, but it does also work at 5V, with 5V it's reaching only
+10V instead of +12V, but does still work; the voltages are required for DRAM
and video signal generation).<br>
Basically 5V and 9V could be directly shortcut with each other, however, the
diode has two purposes: First, it prevents 9V being passed to 5V (in case
somebody connects a 9V supply). Second, it reduces noise from the voltage
generator on the 5V line (without the diode one might need a larger 2200uF
capactitor instead of 470uF one).<br>
Caution - The 5V solution has two disadvantages: The TV modulator does no
longer work (not sure why, maybe it requires full 12V, or maybe the voltage
generator is producing too much noise when driven at 5V) (anyways, the AV
cinch output does work). And, it doesn't output 9V on the expansion port
(which may be required by some expansion hardware).<br>
<br>
<b>Step 5 - Connect Keyboard</b><br>
The keyboard is connected via extremly fragile printed plastic wires, which
tend to break when fiddling with them (or just when they get old). The
membrane with the keyboard matrix consists of the same material, but the
wires are the most fragile part.<br>
Desolder the keyboard connectors. Connect real metal wires to the connectors.
Cut the original plasitic wires close to the membrane. Carefully slide the
connectors on the remaining ends (best, put the ends on a solid surface, if
there's no good surfaces: put 1-2 layers of board under the ends, then firmly
push the ends onto that surface, and move the connector onto the cable;
rather than trying to move the cable into the connector. If needed, add some
tuner/contact spray, and move the cable end in and out a little. Finally,
glue the connectors to the case.<br>
<br>
<b>Software</b><br>
The transmit function (for uploading .TAP files to the Spectrum) is found in
no$zx's "Utility" menu. The "Utility" menu also contains a function called
Create Patched BIOS Image, which creates a file called XMITSPEC.ROM, which is
to be stored in the EPROM; the ROM-image is 32K in size, containing two
copies (one original, and one patched) of the ZX Spectrum BIOS.<br>
<br>
<b>Note</b><br>
Above Pin-numbers are for Spectrum 48K Issue 2 board (some may vary on other
boards). The transmit software currently works only with ZX Spectrum
16K/48K/Plus (not with Spectrum 128 and up).<br>

<b>PC8300 BASIC</b><br>
The BASIC syntax is more or less the same as on ZX81, so it accepts ZX81
BASIC type-in listings in most cases, there is also (limited) support for
loading ZX81 cassette files. A few commands/functions are different: LOG
(instead LN), LET (can be optionally omitted), and the quad-quotes token ("")
isn't supported (ie. one cannot define double-quotes in strings). Additional
commands are TEMPO, MUSIC, SOUND, BEEP, NOBEEP (for internal speaker), and
INK, PAPER, BORDER (for external COLOR module).<br>
<br>
<b>PC8300 BIOS</b><br>
The BIOS is apparently based on a disassembled and modified ZX81 BIOS. About
ALL procedures are moved to different addresses, so there's no compatibility
when CALLing BIOS functions. Only the INT and NMI handler are (more or less)
same as in ZX81 (the timings are slightly changed, the INT handler has same
function, but C and B registers are exchanged).<br>
<br>
<b>PC8300 RAM</b><br>
Some entries in system area are modified. D_FILE is hardcoded at 407Dh,
D_FILE is always expanded (full 1+33*24 bytes). BASIC program is located
after D_FILE (ie. always at 4396h since D_FILE has fixed size). The BASIC
program is terminated by an FFh byte (ZX81 has no such end byte). The
remaining memory (VARS and up) is same as on ZX81.<br>
The RAMTOP detection supports up to 32K RAM (unlike ZX81 which detects max
16K). The Lambda includes 2K RAM built-in (unlike 1K in ZX81). Note: despite
of its name, the Marathon 32K also has only 2K RAM built-in (not 32K).<br>
<br>
<b>PC8300 CHARSET</b><br>
Six characters are different as on ZX81. The charset is located in the ULA
chip without using I register (the ZX81 has it in BIOS ROM, accessed via
I=1Eh). Accordingly, changing the I register doesn't affect video (so neither
True Hires nor Pseudo Hires will work, and any UDG/CHRs hardware expansions
won't work either). The CPU can read the charset via I/O ports (mainly
required for printers).<br>
The video output is reportedly the inverse of ZX81, ie. white text on black
background with black screen border.<br>
<br>
<b>PC8300 PRINTERS</b><br>
The BIOS supports the Sinclair Printer as well as an external Centronics
interface. The Centronics feature includes two modes: ZX chars converted to
ASCII, or ZX chars converted to bitmaps (via ESC codes, which must be
supported by the printer).<br>
<br>
<b>PC8300 KEYBOARD</b><br>
42 Keys. The left 40 keys are same as on ZX81. The upper right key is wired
to /RESET causing a warmboot (pressing /RESET+ENTER forces a coldboot,
/RESET+L_KEY jumps to 2000h in external memory such like ROM, or COLOR RAM).
The lower right key is same as the left SHIFT key. Punctuation marks and
Cursor, Rubout, Edit, Graphics keys are at different location as than in
ZX81. Commands are entered letter-by-letter (eg. type L-O-A-D, unlike
pressing J on ZX81).<br>
<br>
<b>PC8300 SOUND</b><br>
Contains a built-in speaker. The output level can be toggled HIGH/LOW by
reading from an I/O port. Allows to produce a single square wave at fixed
volume (though using PWM, one could eventually mix multiple channels at
variable volume). Since both sound and video require a lot of CPU load, it's
barely possible to output sound &amp; video together. The BEEP (keyclick) is a
very remarkable feature: each key has a different tone assigned, resulting in
a funny melodic old-school SciFi typing effect.<br>
<br>
<b>PC8300 SOFTWARE</b><br>

images. Strange RAW &lt;--&gt; A83 conversion programs exists (purpose unknown).<br>

<br>
<b>PC8300 FILES</b><br>
Cassette files are SAVEd with circa 16000 leading sync pulses (though, this
is a fake, the LOAD function simply ignores them). Followed  by a ZX81-style
file: Some silence, followed by the Filename terminated with bit7=1, followed
by memory at [4009h..[4014h]-1]. The memory content isn't ZX81 compatibile
though (different system area, different D_FILE location, different BASIC
tokens). The VERSN byte at 4009h is FFh (unlike 00h on ZX81).<br>
Bits and bytes are encoded same as on ZX81 (0=four pulses, 1=nine pulses,
with same pulse/silence timings).<br>
<br>
<b>PC8300 SUPPORT FOR ZX81 FILES</b><br>
The Lambda BIOS can load ZX81 files, but with several restrictions: The files
are converted to Lambda format (and cannot be converted back to ZX81 format).
Information in the system area (such like Autostart), and VARS and D_FILE
regions are discarded (only the raw BASIC code is accepted).<br>
BUG: After loading a ZX81 file, the BIOS accidently jumps to 2000h, normally
this is a mirror of 0000h which produces a warmboot - however, it'll crash if
a Color RAM expansion is installed (workaround: POKE a RST0 opcode to 2000h),
or accidently start any expansion ROM at 2000h.<br>
<br>
<b>PC8300 COLOR EXPANSION</b><br>
Colors are optionally supported via an external color module. The Lambda BIOS
contains built-in commands (INK/PAPER/BORDER) for it. The module connects to
expansion port, and also to the monochrome composite video output, deciphers
the "analogue" signal into TTL black/white and TTL sync/nosync signals.<br>
Color attribtes are stored in 1K read/write-able RAM at 2000h..23FFh. During
drawing, the module takes the D_FILE address (usually 407Dh..4395h) ANDed
with 3FFh as index in the RAM, and reads the color attribute for the current
character. The attributes associated with the HALT opcodes in D_FILE define
the current section of the screen border color. The attribute bytes are
Bit0-2 = INK, Bit4-6 = PAPER/BORDER, bit3,7 can be used as general purpose
flags, but do not affect the video output. The monochrome luminance level
selects INK/PAPER, but otherwise doesn't affect the outgoing signal (eg.
PEN=3 and PAPER=3 do produce exactly the same color &amp; same brightness).<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>   XXX does the border affect the COLOR BURST signal?

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
<b>PC8300 TIMINGS</b><br>
The INT handler (0038h) is made 1 cycle slower as than on ZX81, meaning that
the Lambda executes 208 clks/scanline (ZX81 only 207 clks).<br>
The NMI handler is "improved" (the useless JP opcode removed, but the JR is
replaced by a JP, so there is no speedup gained, to the worst, there's a
bizarre NOP inserted making NMI handling 4 cycles slower than on ZX81, making
the SLOW mode even slower-than-slow.<br>

<b>PC8300 BIOS-MOD</b><br>
There is also an alternate Lambda BIOS in the internet. It's source is
unknown, it seems to be an commercial or homebrewn BIOS replacement, intended
to improve ZX81 compatibility (called "replacement" because the BIOS doesn't
match-up with the Lambda keyboard, so it's unlikely that Lambda's were sold
with that BIOS built-in).<br>
Patched TS1500 BIOS (around 1K modified, remaining 7K same as in original
BIOS). RAMTOP is hardcoded as 16K (won't work with less memory). Frame rate
is hardcoded as 60Hz. Keyboard layout is same as in ZX81 (cursor keys,
punctuation marks, and token-hotkeys don't match up with the Lambda
keyboard). Doesn't include charset in BIOS (uses the Lambda ULA charset, so,
for video and printer output, six chars are still different as on ZX81).<br>
Fileformat and memory map are exactly same as in ZX81, so it's compatible
with machine code programs with hardcoded ZX81 memory addresses. System area
is same as ZX81, though with some extra bits in 403Bh (bit3=REM n Cursor
Blink Enable, bit4=STEP n Auto-Edit enable, bit5=BEEP n Keyclick Beep
disable) and 407Bh (16bit Cursor address for blink).<br>
BASIC includes some new/modified commands/functions: BEEP n (n=1 enables
keyclick sounds, n=0 disables it), IN/OUT (executes IN/OUT opcode, the port
address is only 8bit wide, not 16bit), STEP n (usually suffix for FOR, but in
this BIOS it can be also as command to edit line "n" and all
following/existing lines), REM n (n=1 enables cursor blink, n=0 disables it).<br>

<b>Video Capabilities</b><br>
With only 1K Charset RAM, the Jupiter is more restrictive than a ZX Spectrum
(or HiRes ZX81) with 6K Bitmap RAM. On the other hand, there's more CPU load
available than on ZX81, so the Jupiter has some potential.<br>
Possible would be games with not too detailed graphics (like racing games
which have relative featureless BG graphics, or shoot-em-ups without BG
graphics, etc.)<br>
Another approach would be a medium-resolution Bitmap with 128x96 pixels
(using 128 characters with 4x4 pixel "block graphics", and their inverses,
giving 256 characters in total).<br>

<br>
<b>VSYNC Interrupt</b><br>
The default interrupt handler at 0038h isn't too useful, however, one can put
a custom IM2 interrupt handler in RAM. The Z80's /INT pin is wired directly
to /VSYNC. This implies two problems:<br>
1) The /VSYNC signal is LOW for 8 scanlines (1664 cycles), so, the IRQ
handler should not re-enable IRQs during that period (otherwise the same
interrupt would be executed another time). If necessary include a 1664-cycle
delay in the IRQ handler, or return without enabling IRQs.<br>
2) For flicker/waitstate-free drawing, it'd be ideal to access VRAM during
VBLANK, but since /INT is generated on VSYNC rather than VBLANK, one can use
only little more than half of the VBLANK periond.<br>

<b>.TAP Images</b><br>
Jupiter ACE cassette images are stored in .TAP files, using the same

difference is that Jupiter ACE images do not contain Blocktype bytes
(software must insert the missing byles: toggle between FFh or 00h on each
second block). Most or all .TAP images are starting with a header block, so
the first 2 bytes in the file should be 0019h for Jupiter ACE, and 0013h for

<b>Starting files</b><br>
There is no (intended) autostart mechanism provided. The normal way to load
and start ACE files is bizarre and usually requires detailed loading
instructions: One must know both the name of the file, and name of its "main"
function, in some cases one must also manually execute initialization
functions. For example Jupiter Cantab's "Worms" is - seriously - meant to be
started like so:<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  LOAD worms GET graphics GO
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>If the names are unknown one can do: To discover file names: Type &lt;LOAD
dummy&gt;, watch the first filename listed on screen, rewind tape, type &lt;LOAD
filename&gt;.<br>
To discover function names: Type VLIST, watch the function/variable names
(watch quickly - before they get scrolled offscreen). Then try typing some of
the names, hoping that it's the main function (variables will produce errors,
subfunctions may act useless) (to start with: &lt;FILENAME&gt;, GO, RUN, PLAY,
START, MAIN, GAME, etc. would be possible candidates) (some programs may have
multiple main funtions, eg. PLAY/HELP, or PLAY_EASY/PLAY_DIFFICULT).<br>
<br>
<b>Empty Filenames</b><br>
The BIOS doesn't allow to SAVE something without filenames, however, it can
LOAD such files (so, with suitable tools, one can create files with empty,
space-padded filenames). There is no "wildcard" to LOAD the first file on
tape, so - unless it's empty - the user must always type-in the filename.<br>
<br>
<b>Autostarting Files</b><br>
There are two ways to autostart binary files by just typing "0 0 BLOAD" (or
"0. BLOAD"):<br>
1) Load the entrypoint to EXWRCH in system area (EXWRCH gets executed almost
immediately after loading when the BIOS wants to display "OK"). This method
is best for machine code.<br>
2) Load a commandline string into the Input Buffer in VRAM (ie. load
&lt;00h,"LOAD filename mainfunction"&gt; to address 22E0h). This method is best for
FORTH programs, and existing (older) files which originally didn't include
autostart.<br>
The VRAM method is used by Spacefighter (also loads a picture into VRAM
alongside with the commandline). The EXWRCH method is used by Magic Floor.<br>
Autostarting works only with BLOAD, not with LOAD (the FORTH fileheader
doesn't include any useful entries; the relocation feature could be tweaked
to add an offset to whatever memory locations, but that offset is usually
0000h, so it'd be useless).<br>

<b>Word definitions</b><br>
Defining a word (a procedure, variable, etc.) doesn't erase old words with
the same name, same applies when LOADing words from tape. So, it can happen
that a word is defined multiple times, of which, fortran will "see" the
newest definition; one can also make "newer" definitions of the predefined
ROM words.<br>

<b>Normal 8bit and 16bit Registers</b><br>
The Accumulator (A) is the allround register for 8bit operations.
Registers B, C, D, E, H, L are normal 8bit registers, which can be also
accessed as 16bit register pairs BC, DE, HL.<br>
The HL register pair is used as allround register for 16bit operations.
B and BC are sometimes used as counters. DE is used as DEstination
pointer in block transfer commands.<br>
<br>
<b>Second Register Set</b><br>
The Z80 includes a second register set (AF',BC',DE',HL') these
registers cannot be accessed directly, but can be exchanged with the
normal registers by using the EX AF,AF and EXX instructions.<br>
<br>
<b>Refresh Register</b><br>
The lower 7 bits of the Refresh Register (R) are incremented with every
instruction. Instructions with at least one prefix-byte (CB,DD,ED,FD, or
DDCB,FDCB) will increment the register twice. Bit 7 can be used by
programmer to store data. Permanent writing to this register will
suppress memory refresh signals, causing Dynamic RAM to lose data.<br>
<br>
<b>Interrupt Register</b><br>
The Interrupt Register (I) is used in interrupt mode 2 only (see command
"im 2"). In other modes it can be used as simple 8bit data register.<br>
<br>
<b>IX and IY Registers</b><br>
IX and IY are able to manage almost all the things that HL is able to
do. When used as memory pointers they are additionally including a
signed index byte (IX+d). The disadvantage is that the opcodes occupy
more memory bytes, and that they are less fast than HL-instructions.<br>
<br>
<b>Undocumented 8bit Registers</b><br>
IXH, IXL, IYH, IYL are undocumented 8bit registers which can be used to
access high and low bytes of the IX and IY registers (much like H and L
for HL). Even though these registers do not officially exist, they seem
to be available in all Z80 CPUs, and are quite commonly used by various
software.<br>

<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  Bit Name  Set  Clr  Expl.

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
<b>Carry Flag (C)</b><br>
This flag signalizes if the result of an arithmetic operation exceeded
the maximum range of 8 or 16 bits, ie. the flag is set if the result was
less than Zero, or greater than 255 (8bit) or 65535 (16bit). After
rotate/shift operations the bit that has been 'shifted out' is stored in
the carry flag.<br>
<br>
<b>Zero Flag (Z)</b><br>
Signalizes if the result of an operation has been zero (Z) or not zero
(NZ). Note that the flag is set (1) if the result was zero (0).<br>
<br>
<b>Sign Flag (S)</b><br>
Signalizes if the result of an operation is negative (M) or positive
(P), the sign flag is just a copy of the most significant bit of the
result.<br>
<br>
<b>Parity/Overflow Flag (P/V)</b><br>
This flag is used as Parity Flag, or as Overflow Flag, or for other
purposes, depending on the instruction.<br>
Parity: Bit7 XOR Bit6 XOR Bit5 ... XOR Bit0 XOR 1.<br>
8bit Overflow: Indicates if the result was greater/less than +127/-128.<br>
HL Overflow: Indicates if the result was greater/less than +32767/-32768.<br>
After LD A,I or LD A,R: Contains current state of IFF2.<br>
After LDI,LDD,CPI,CPD,CPIR,CPDR: Set if BC&lt;&gt;0 at end of operation.<br>
<br>
<b>BCD Flags (H,N)</b><br>
These bits are solely supposed to be used by the DAA instruction. The N
flag signalizes if the previous operation has be an addition or
substraction. The H flag indicates if the lower 4 bits exceeded the
range from 0-0Fh. (For 16bit instructions: H indicates if the lower 12
bits exceeded the range from 0-0FFFh.)<br>
After adding/subtracting two 8bit BCD values (0-99h) the DAA instruction
can be used to convert the hexadecimal result in the A register (0-FFh)
back to BCD format (0-99h). Note that DAA also requires the carry flag
to be set correctly, and thus should not be used after INC A or DEC A.<br>
<br>
<b>Undocumented Flags (Bit 3,5)</b><br>
The content of these undocumented bits is filled by garbage by all
instructions that affect one or more of the normal flags (for more info
read the chapter Garbage in Flag Register), the only way to read out
these flags would be to copy the flags register onto the stack by using
the PUSH AF instruction.<br>
However, the existence of these bits makes the AF register a full 16bit
register, so that for example the code sequence PUSH DE, POP AF, PUSH
AF, POP HL would set HL=DE with all 16bits intact.<br>

<b>Commands and Parameters</b><br>
Each instruction consists of a command, and optionally one or two
parameters. Usually the leftmost parameter is modified by the operation
when two parameters are specified.<br>
<br>
<b>Parameter Placeholders</b><br>
The following placeholders are used in the following chapters:<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  r      8bit  register A,B,C,D,E,H,L
  rr     16bit register BC, DE, HL/IX/IY, AF/SP   (as described)
  i      8bit  register A,B,C,D,E,IXH/IYH,IXL/IYL
  ii     16bit register IX,IY
  n      8bit  immediate 00-FFh                   (unless described else)
  nn     16bit immediate 0000-FFFFh
  d      8bit  signed offset -128..+127
  f      flag  condition nz,z,nc,c AND/OR po,pe,p,m  (as described)
  (..)   16bit pointer to byte/word in memory
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
<b>Opcode Bytes</b><br>
Each command (including parameters) consists of 1-4 bytes. The
respective bytes are described in the following chapters. In some cases
the register number or other parameters are encoded into some bits of
the opcode, in that case the opcode is specified as "xx". Opcode prefix
bytes "DD" (IX) and "FD" (IY) are abbreviated as "pD".<br>
<br>
<b>Clock Cycles</b><br>
The clock cycle values in the following chapters specify the execution
time of the instruction. For example, an 8-cycle instruction would take
2 microseconds on a CPU which is operated at 4MHz (8/4 ms). For
conditional instructions two values are specified, for example, 17;10
means 17 cycles if condition true, and 10 cycles if false.<br>
Note that in case that WAIT signals are sent to the CPU by the hardware
then the execution may take longer.<br>
<br>
<b>Affected Flags</b><br>
The instruction tables below are including a six character wide field
for the six flags: Sign, Zero, Halfcarry, Parity/Overflow, N-Flag, and
Carry (in that order). The meaning of the separate characters is:<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  s    Indicates Signed result
  z    Indicates Zero
  h    Indicates Halfcarry
  o    Indicates Overflow
  p    Indicates Parity
  c    Indicates Carry
  -    Flag is not affected
  0    Flag is cleared
  1    Flag is set
  x    Flag is destroyed (unspecified)
  i    State of IFF2
  e    Indicates BC&lt;&gt;0 for LDX(R) and CPX(R), or B=0 for INX(R) and OUTX(R)

<b>Interrupt Flip-Flop (IFF1,IFF2)</b><br>
The IFF1 flag is used to enable/disable INTs (maskable interrupts).<br>
In a raw INT-based system, IFF2 is always having the same state than
IFF1. However, in a NMI-based system the IFF2 flag is used to backup the
recent IFF1 state prior to NMI execution, and may be used to restore
IFF1 upon NMI completion by RETN opcode.<br>
Beside for the above 'backup' function, IFF2 itself is having no effect.
Neither IFF1 nor IFF2 affect NMIs which are always enabled.<br>
The following opcodes/events are modifying IFF1 and/or IFF2:<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  EI     IFF1=1, IFF2=1
  DI     IFF1=0, IFF2=0
  &lt;INT&gt;  IFF1=0, IFF2=0
  &lt;NMI&gt;  IFF1=0
  RETI   IFF1=IFF2
  RETN   IFF1=IFF2
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>When using the EI instruction, the new IFF state isn't applied until the
next instruction has completed (this ensures that an interrupt handler
which is using the sequence "EI, RET" may return to the main program
before the next interrupt is executed).<br>
Interrupts can be disabled by the DI instruction (IFF=0), and are
additionally automatically each time when an interrupt is executed.<br>
<br>
<b>Interrupt Execution</b><br>
An interrupt is executed when an interrupt is requested by the hardware,
and IFF is set. Whenever both conditions are true, the interrupt is
executed after the completion of the current opcode.<br>
Note that repeated block commands (such like LDIR) can be interrupted
also, the interrupt return address on the stack then points to the
interrupted opcode, so that the instruction may continue as normal once
the interrupt handler returns.<br>
<br>
<b>Interrupt Modes (IM 0,1,2)</b><br>
The Z80 supports three interrupt modes which can be selected by IM 0, IM
1, and IM 2 instructions. The table below describes the respective
operation and execution time in each mode.<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  Mode  Cycles  Refresh  Operation
  0     1+var   0+var    IFF1=0,IFF2=0, read and execute opcode from databus
  1     12      1        IFF1=0,IFF2=0, CALL 0038h
  2     18      1        IFF1=0,IFF2=0, CALL [I*100h+databus]
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>Mode 0 requires an opcode to be output to the databus by external
hardware, in case that no byte is output, and provided that the 'empty'
databus is free of garbage, then the CPU might tend to read a value of
FFh (opcode RST 38h, 11 cycles, 1 refresh) - the clock cycles (11+1),
refresh cycles (1), and executed operation are then fully identical as
in Mode 1.<br>
Mode 1 interrupts always perform a CALL 0038h operation. The downside is
that many systems may have ROM located at this address, making it
impossible to hook the interrupt handler directly.<br>
<br>
Mode 2 calls to a 16bit address which is read from a table in memory,
the table pointer is calculated from the "I" register (initialized by LD
I,A instruction) multiplied by 100h, plus an index byte which is read
from the databus. The following trick may be used to gain stable results
in Mode 2 even if no index byte is supplied on the databus: For example,
set I=40h the origin of the table will be then at 4000h in memory. Now
fill the entire area from 4000h to 4100h (101h bytes, including 4100h)
by the value 41h. The CPU will then perform a CALL 4141h upon interrupt
execution - regardless of whether the randomized index byte is an even
or odd number.<br>
<br>
<b>Non-Maskable Interrupts (NMIs)</b><br>
Unlike INTs, NMIs cannot be disabled by the CPU, ie. DI and EI
instructions and the state of IFF1 and IFF2 do not have effect on NMIs.
The NMI handler address is fixed at 0066h, regardless of the interrupt
mode (IM). Upon NMI execution, IFF1 is cleared (disabeling maskable INTs
- NMIs remain enabled, which may result in nested execution if the
handler does not return before next NMI is requested). IFF2 remains
unchanged, thus containing the most recent state of IFF1, which may be
used to restore IFF1 if the NMI handler returns by RETN instruction.<br>
Execution time for NMIs is unknown (?).<br>
<br>
<b>RETN (return from NMI and restore IFF1)</b><br>
Intended to return from NMI and to restore the old IFF1 state (assuming the
old state was IFF1/IFF2 both set or both cleared).<br>
<br>
<b>RETI (return from INT with external acknowledge)</b><br>
Intended to return from INT and to notify peripherals about completion of the
INT handler, the Z80 itself doesn't send any such acknowledge signal
(instead, peripherals like Z80-PIO or Z80-SIO must decode the databus during
/M1 cycles, and identify the opcode sequence EDh,4Fh as RETI). Aside from
such external handling, internally, RETI is exactly same as RETN, and, like
RETN it does set IFF1=IFF2 (though in case of RETI this is a dirt effect
without practical use; within INT handlers IFF1 and IFF2 are always both
zero, or when EI was used both set). Recommended methods to return from INT
are: EI+RETI (when needing the external acknowledge), or EI+RET (faster).<br>

<b>Mirrored Instructions</b><br>
NEG  (ED44) is mirrored to ED4C,54,5C,64,6C,74,7C.<br>
RETN (ED45) is mirrored to ED55,65,75.<br>
RETI (ED4D) is mirrored to ED5D,6D,7D.<br>
<br>
<b>Mirrored IM Instructions</b><br>
IM 0,X,1,2 (ED46,4E,56,5E) are mirrored to ED66,6E,76,7E.<br>
Whereas IM X is an undocumented mirrored instruction itself which
appears to be identical to either IM 0 or IM 1 instruction (?).<br>
<br>
<b>Duplicated LD HL Instructions</b><br>
LD (nn),HL (opcode 22NNNN) is mirrored to ED63NNNN.<br>
LD HL,(nn) (opcode 2ANNNN) is mirrored to ED6BNNNN.<br>
Unlike the other instructions in this chapter, these two opcodes are
officially documented. The clock/refresh cycles for the mirrored
instructions are then 20/2 instead of 16/1 as for the native 8080
instructions.<br>
<br>
<b>Mirrored BIT N,(ii+d) Instructions</b><br>
Unlike as for RES and SET, the BIT instruction does not support a third
operand, ie. DD or FD prefixes cannot be used on a BIT N,r instruction
in order to produce a BIT r,N,(ii+d) instruction. When attempting this,
the 'r' operand is ignored, and the resulting instruction is identical
to BIT N,(ii+d).<br>
Except that, not tested yet, maybe undocumented flags are then read from
'r' instead of from ii+d(?).<br>
<br>
<b>Non-Functional Opcodes</b><br>
The following opcodes behave much like the NOP instruction.<br>
ED00-3F, ED77, ED7F, ED80-9F, EDA4-A7, EDAC-AF, EDB4-B7, EDBC-BF, EDC0-FF.<br>
The execution time for these opcodes is 8 clock cycles, 2 refresh cycles.<br>
Note that some of these opcodes appear to be used for additional
instructions by the R800 CPU in newer turbo R (MSX) models.<br>
<br>
<b>Ignored DD and FD Prefixes</b><br>
In some cases, DD-prefixes (IX) and FD-prefixes (IY) may be ignored by
the CPU. This happens when using one (or more) of the above prefixes
prior to instructions that already contain an ED, DD, or FD prefix, or
prior to any instructions that do not support IX, IY, IXL, IXH, IYL, IYH
operands. In such cases, 4 clock cycles and 1 refresh cycle are counted
for each ignored prefix byte.<br>

<b>Nocash Z80-flags description</b><br>
This chapter describes the undocumented Z80 flags (bit 3 and 5 of the
Flags Register), these flags are affected by ALL instructions that
modify one or more of the normal flags - all OTHER instructions do NOT
affect the undocumented flags.<br>
<br>
For some instructions, the content of some flags has been officially
documented as 'destroyed', indicating that the flags contain garbage,
the exact garbage calculation for these instructions will be described
here also.<br>
<br>
All information below just for curiosity. Keep in mind that Z80
compatible CPUs (or emulators) may not supply identical results, so that
it wouldn't be a good idea to use these flags in any programs (not that
they could be very useful anyways).<br>
<br>
<b>Normal Behaviour for Undocumented Flags</b><br>
In most cases, undocumented flags are copied from the Bit 3 and Bit 5 of
the result byte. That is "A AND 28h" for:<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  RLD; CPL; RLCA; RLA; LD A,I; ADD OP; ADC OP; XOR OP; AND OP;
  RRD; NEG; RRCA; RRA; LD A,R; SUB OP; SBC OP; OR OP ; DAA.
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>When other operands than A may be modified, "OP AND 28h" for:<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  RLC OP; RL OP; SLA OP; SLL OP; INC OP; IN OP,(C);
  RRC OP; RR OP; SRA OP; SRL OP; DEC OP
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>For 16bit instructions flags are calculated as "RR AND 2800h":<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  ADD RR,XX; ADC RR,XX; SBC RR,XX.
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
<b>Slightly Special Undocumented Flags</b><br>
For 'CP OP' flags are calculated as "OP AND 28h", that is the unmodified
operand, and NOT the internally calculated result of the comparision.<br>
For 'SCF' and 'CCF' flags are calculated as "(A OR F) AND 28h", ie. the flags
remain set if they have been previously set.<br>
For 'BIT N,R' flags are calculated as "OP AND 28h", additionally the
P-Flag is set to the same value than the Z-Flag (ie. the Parity of "OP
AND MASK"), and the S-flag is set to "OP AND MASK AND 80h".<br>
<br>
<b>Fatal MEMPTR Undocumented Flags</b><br>
For 'BIT N,(HL)' the P- and S-flags are set as for BIT N,R, but the
undocumented flags are calculated as "MEMPTR AND 2800h", for more info
about MEMPTR read on below.<br>
The same applies to 'BIT N,(ii+d)', but the result is less unpredictable
because the instruction sets MEMPTR=ii+d, so that undocumented flags are
"&lt;ii+d&gt; AND 2800h".<br>
<br>
<b>Memory Block Command Undocumented Flags</b><br>
For LDI, LDD, LDIR, LDDR, undocumented flags are "((A+DATA) AND 08h) +
((A+DATA) AND 02h)*10h".<br>
For CPI, CPD, CPIR, CPDR, undocumented flags are "((A-DATA-FLG_H) AND
08h) + ((A-DATA-FLG_H) AND 02h)*10h", whereas the CPU first calculates
A-DATA, and then internally subtracts the resulting H-flag from the
result.<br>
<br>
<b>Chaotic I/O Block Command Flags</b><br>
The INI, IND, INIR, INDR, OUTI, OUTD, OTIR, OTDR instructions are doing
a lot of obscure things, to simplify the description a placeholder
called DUMMY is used in the formulas.<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  DUMMY = "REG_C+DATA+1"    ;for INI/INIR
  DUMMY = "REG_C+DATA-1"    ;for IND/INDR
  DUMMY = "REG_L+DATA"      ;for OUTI,OUTD,OTIR,OTDR
  FLG_C = Carry  of above "DUMMY" calculation
  FLG_H = Carry  of above "DUMMY" calculation (same as FLG_C)
  FLG_N = Sign   of "DATA"
  FLG_P = Parity of "REG_B XOR (DUMMY AND 07h)"
  FLG_S = Sign   of "REG_B"
  UNDOC = Bit3,5 of "REG_B AND 28h"
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>The above registers L and B are meant to contain the new values which
are already incremented/decremented by the instruction.<br>
Note that the official docs mis-described the N-Flag as set, and the
C-Flag as not affected.<br>
<br>
<b>DAA Flags</b><br>
Addition (if N was 0):<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  FLG_H = (OLD_A AND 0Fh) &gt; 09h
  FLG_C = Carry of result
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>Subtraction (if N was 1):<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  FLG_H = (NEW_A AND 0Fh) &gt; 09h
  FLG_C = OLD_CARRY OR (OLD_A&gt;99h)
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>For both addition and subtraction, N remains unmodified, and S, Z, P
contain "Sign", Zero, and Parity of result (A). Undocumented flags are
set to (A AND 28h) as normal.<br>
<br>
<b>Mis-documented Flags</b><br>
For all XOR/OR: H=N=C=0, and for all AND: H=1, N=C=0, unlike described
else in Z80 docs. Also note C,N flag description bug for I/O block
commands (see above).<br>
<br>
<b>Internal MEMPTR Register</b><br>
This is an internal Z80 register, modified by some instructions, and
usually completely hidden to the user, except that Bit 11 and Bit 13 can
be read out at a later time by BIT N,(HL) instructions.<br>
The following list specifies the resulting content of the MEMPTR
register caused by the respective instructions.<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  Content Instruction

<br>
<table width="100%"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#cccccc"><td><a name="z80compatibility"></a><font size="+2">&nbsp;Z80 Compatibility</font></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
The Z80 CPU is (almost) fully backwards compatible to older 8080 and
8085 CPUs.<br>
<br>
<b>Instruction Format</b><br>
The Z80 syntax simplifies the chaotic 8080/8085 syntax. For example, Z80
uses the command "LD" for all load instructions, 8080/8085 used various
different commands depending on whether the operands are 8bit registers,
16bit registers, memory pointers, and/or an immediates. However, these
changes apply to the source code only - the generated binary code is
identical for both CPUs.<br>
<br>
<b>Parity/Overflow Flag</b><br>
The Z80 CPU uses Bit 2 of the flag register as Overflow flag for
arithmetic instructions, and as Parity flag for other instructions.
8080/8085 CPUs are always using this bit as Parity flag for both
arithmetic and non-arithmetic instructions.<br>
<br>
<b>Z80 Specific Instructions</b><br>
The following instructions are available for Z80 CPUs only, but not for
older 8080/8085 CPUs:<br>
All CB-prefixed opcodes (most Shift/Rotate, all BIT/SET/RES commands).<br>
All ED-prefixed opcodes (various instructions, and all block commands).<br>
All DD/FD-prefixed opcodes (registers IX and IY).<br>
As well as DJNZ nn; JR nn; JR f,nn; EX AF,AF; and EXX.<br>
<br>
<b>8085 Specific Instructions</b><br>
The 8085 instruction set includes two specific opcodes in addition to
the 8080 instruction set, used to control 8085-specifc interrupts and
SID and SOD input/output signals. These opcodes, RIM (20h) and SIM
(30h), are not supported by Z80/8080 CPUs.<br>
<br>
<b>Z80 vs Z80A</b><br>
Both Z80 and Z80A are including the same instruction set, the only
difference is the supported clock frequency (Z80 = max 2.5MHz, Z80A =
max 4MHz).<br>
<br>
<b>NEC-780 vs Zilog-Z80</b><br>
These CPUs are apparently fully compatible to each other, including for
undocumented flags and undocumented opcodes.<br>

<b>CPU and System Clock Overview</b><br>
The ZX81 is equipped with a NEC D780C-1 CPU (fully compatible to Zilog
Z80 CPUs, including for undocumented opcodes &amp; flags). The CPU is
operated at 3.25 MHz (generated by a 6.5MHz oscillator with very high
tolerance - my ZX81 appears to be rather ticking at 3.33MHz even though
the oscillator DOES have the value 6.5 printed onto it) the available
CPU time is reduced when the display is enabled. The ZX81 produces a
/WAIT signal for the duration while a NMI is requested, otherwise the
CPU runs free of waitstates.<br>
<br>
<b>Vectors, Registers and Memory Overview</b><br>
The INT, NMI, and RST vectors are located in ROM and cannot be changed
by software. The AF' register (ie. EX AF,AF), the IX register, and IR
register (interrupt/refresh) are reserved for video and should be
normally not used, except in FAST mode. Attempting to execute program
code stored at addresses 8000h-FFFFh is interpreted as video data (if
the opcodes Bit 6 was set), if so, a NOP opcode is forwarded to the CPU.<br>
<br>
<b>Using Machine Code</b><br>
A machine code program is called by using the USR function, for example
by using the BASIC expression "LET N=USR &lt;startaddress&gt;", startaddress
must be a decimal number (hex numbers are not supported). If the machine
code program returns to BASIC, the content of the BC register is used as
return value. For info about storing binary data/machine code, see
Memory chapter.<br>

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>Beside for these general special keys, all ZX81 keys are behaving kinda
special, depending on various input modes as shown below.<br>
<br>
<b>[K] Cursor - Keyword Mode (Expecting Keywords and/or Line Numbers)</b><br>
This mode is automatically used at the beginning of each line (and after THEN).<br>
At the beginning of line, a line number can be entered by using 0-9 keys.
Character keys are interpreted as command keywords (for example, P=PRINT).
Some commands must be entered as SHIFT combinations (for example,
SHIFT+F=FAST).<br>
Entering a line number without keyword deletes the specified line.<br>
<br>
<b>[L] Cursor - Letter Mode (Expecting Operands or Functions)</b><br>
This mode is automatically selected after entering a keyword in [K] mode.<br>
Allows to enter expressions, such like "HELLO" or 1234.5678. When SHIFT is
held down, functions/operators such like +,-,*,&gt;=,OR,AND can be entered (for
example, SHIFT+W=OR), note that typing "OR" as characters by pressing "O",
"R" will result in syntax errors.<br>
<br>
<b>[F] Cursor - Function Mode (Expecting Functions) (ZX81 only)</b><br>
This mode is entered by pressing SHIFT+ENTER from inside of [L] Mode,
allowing to enter functions such like L=USR, U=CHR$ which cannot be
entered in [L] mode directly.<br>
<br>
<b>[G] Cursor - Graphics Mode (Inverted Text and Block Graphics) (ZX81 only)</b><br>
This mode is entered by pressing SHIFT+9 from inside of [L] Mode,
allowing to enter inverted characters (including inverted SPACE).<br>
When keeping SHIFT held down, all combinations of Block Graphics can be
entered (for example, SHIFT+1=Dot-in-upper-left).<br>
<br>
<b>[&gt;] Cursor/Symbol - Currently selected line</b><br>
This cursor isn't part of the input line. Instead, it is displayed in the
program listing (if any) in the upper screen area. The cursor can be moved by
UP/DOWN key combinations (SHIFT+7/6), causing the listing to be scrolled if
necessary.<br>
The EDIT key combination (SHIFT+1) copies the line that is currently selected
by the [&gt;] Cursor to the input buffer (overwriting any old input).<br>
<br>
<b>[S] Symbol - Syntax Error</b><br>
This is not actually a cursor, when entering an incorrect line, the [S]
symbol appears, indicating the fault position, and prompting the user to
repair the problem.<br>
<br>
<b>Note</b><br>
The ZX80/ZX81 allows only one command per line. On the Spectrum, multiple
commands can be separated by ":" colons.<br>

<table width="100%"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#cccccc"><td><a name="basiccommands"></a><font size="+2">&nbsp;BASIC Commands</font></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
<b>BEEP n,n (Spectrum only)</b><br>
Plays a sound via ULA port FEh. The 1st parameter specifies the duration in
seconds (or fractions thereof, like 0.5), the 2nd parameter specifies the
pitch in semitones above middle C (or below thereof, if negative). The
waveform is software generated, so the program becomes paused during beep.<br>
<br>
<b>BORDER n (Spectrum only)</b><br>
Changes the screen border color (0..7).<br>
<br>
<b>CLEAR [n]</b><br>
Erases all variables and frees up memory. The optional parameter changes
RAMTOP (supported on Spectrum only).<br>
<br>
<b>CIRCLE x,y,radius (Spectrum only)</b><br>
Draws a circle.<br>
<br>
<b>CLS</b><br>
Clears the screen.<br>
<br>
<b>CONT (called CONTINUE on ZX80/Spectrum)</b><br>
Works much like GOTO, continues the program in the current line, or in
the next line if program has been halted by STOP.<br>
<br>
<b>COPY (ZX81/Spectrum only)</b><br>
Sends a screen copy to the printer (if connected). Only topmost 32x22
characters are printed, ie. excluding bottommost 2 lines.<br>
<br>
<b>DATA item[,item[,item]] (Spectrum only)</b><br>
Contains expressions (numbers, variables, or quoted strings) which may be
loaded into variables via READ command. DATA is just a data definition, not
an executable command (trying to execute DATA lines acts as REM lines).<br>
<br>
<b>DEF FN v(v1,v2,etc)=expression (Spectrum only)</b><br>
Creates a user defined function. The function name must be a single letter
expression (like x or a$). For example, "DEF FN s(a)=a*a" would cause "FN
s(n)" to act identical as "n**2".<br>
<br>
<b>DELETE [n],[m] (Timex TS2068/TC2068 only)</b><br>
Deletes BASIC line numbers n..m. Defaults to from 1st/to last line if n/m are
omitted. Note: To delete a single line, simply enter its line number and
press Enter.<br>
<br>
<b>DIM b(n1,...,nk) or DIM b$(n1,...,nk)</b><br>
Defines dimensions for an array. All values (or strings) in the array
are reset to 0, (or SPACE-filled for strings/characters). The lastmost
dimension of a character array indicates the string length. For example,
DIM A$(x,y,z) could be accessed either as three-dimensional character
array A$(x,y,z), or as two-dimensional string array A$(x,y) with
LENGTH=z.<br>
The ZX80 supports only one-dimensional numeric arrays, ie. no
multi-dimensional arrays, and no string/character arrays.<br>
<br>
<b>DRAW x,y[,angle] (Spectrum only)</b><br>
Draws a line (from most recent DRAW/PLOT/CIRCLE position) to x,y. The 3rd
parameter allows to draw curved lines (angle should be below +/-2*PI).<br>
<br>
<b>FAST (ZX81 only)</b><br>
Switches to FAST mode, the CPU focuses on program execution only (approx. 4
times faster) and the display becomes black until end of program, or until
switching to SLOW mode. Also, the screen becomes temporarily enabled during
PAUSE or INPUT periods.<br>
The ZX80 is always operating in 'FAST' mode.<br>
<br>
<b>FOR b=x TO y [STEP z]</b><br>
Defines the begin and range of a FOR-NEXT loop, the default STEP is +1. The
ZX80 doesn't support the STEP operand.<br>
<br>
<b>GOSUB n (called GO SUB on ZX80/Spectrum)</b><br>
Saves RETURN address on GOSUB stack, and jumps to the specified line
number, see GOTO for details.<br>
<br>
<b>GOTO n (called GO TO on ZX80/Spectrum)</b><br>
Jumps to the specified line number. An immediate, a variable and/or
other expression may be used as line number, such like "GOTO A*10+230".<br>
<br>
<b>IF x THEN command</b><br>
Executes command if x&lt;&gt;0 (eg. if an expression like "A=0" is true). The ZX
does not understand "THEN n" as alias for "THEN GOTO n".<br>
<br>
<b>INK/PAPER/FLASH/BRIGHT n (affects VRAM attributes) (Spectrum only)</b><br>
<b>INVERSE/OVER n (affects VRAM bitmap) (Spectrum only)</b><br>
Changes parameters for following printing/drawing operations (like PRINT,
INPUT, PLOT, DRAW, CIRCLE).<br>
INK/PAPER can be a color number in range 0..7, or 8=transparent, FLASH/BRIGHT
can be 0=off, 1=on, or 8=transparent, transparent means that the old
attribute value in VRAM is left unchanged. INVERSE/OVER can be 0=off, or
1=on. INVERSE inverts the character data when printing, or causes pixels to
become 0 when drawing. OVER causes the new character/pixel data to be XORed
with the old VRAM bitmap content.<br>
INK/PAPER/FLASH/BRIGHT/INVERSE/OVER can be used as "standalone" commands
(affecting all following printing/drawing commands) (eg. "INVERSE 1"), or as
"temporary" parameters inserted between a printing/drawing command and its
parameters (affecting only that command) (eg. "PLOT INVERSE 1;x,y" is
equivalent to UNPLOT x,y).<br>
Note: Another way to use colors in printing is to use "hidden" tokens, like
typing PRINT"Hello {INK RED}Test", where {INK RED} is entered as EXT+SHIFT+2.
The {INK RED} token isn't displayed in text form when listing/editing the
program, it just causes the following characters to be drawn in red (this
method was supported only by the original 48K BASIC, and was discontinued in
128 BASIC).<br>
<br>
<b>INPUT ["text",] [LINE] v</b><br>
Prompts the user to enter a value (or string) to be assigned to v. In
FAST mode, the display is temporarily re-enabled. Program is breaked if
user enters STOP as first character.<br>
Strings must enclosed in quotes (otherwise any text input is treated as a
variable). Adding the LINE keyword allows to enter strings without quotes
(Spectrum only). "text" is an optional message displayed on the screen
(Spectrum only).<br>
<br>
<b>LET v=e</b><br>
Assigns e to the variable v. The ZX does not understand "v=e" as alias for
"LET v=e". In case that v is a string-fragment, ie. A$(..TO..), the TO-length
remains unchanged, and truncated/space padded string is assigned to the
TO-area.<br>
<br>
<b>LIST [n]</b><br>
Lists the program on the screen. The default starting line number is 0.
Use CONT to continue if program does not fit onto screen.<br>
<br>
<b>LLIST [n] (ZX81/Spectrum only)</b><br>
Lists the program to the printer.<br>
<br>
<b>LOAD f</b><br>
Loads a memory image from cassette. When specifying an empty filename,
ie. LOAD "", the first encountered file is loaded. Text display is
suspended during loading, white lines are shown on the screen when
receiving cassette signals. The program and all variables that are
already in memory become overwritten.<br>
The memory image contains all memory from 4009h up to (4014h), ie. most
of the system area, the actual BASIC program, the video memory, and any
defined variables. The program is automatically started, continuing at
the next line number, if it has been saved from &lt;inside&gt; of a running
program.<br>
The ZX80 does not support filenames, just type LOAD and hit NEWLINE.<br>
<br>
<b>LPRINT (ZX81/Spectrum only)</b><br>
Works much like PRINT, but outputs to the printer. AT may be used to specify
a horizontal position inside of the currently printed line.<br>
Bug: Numbers with more than one zero in their fractional portion aren't
displayed properly, for example, LPRINT 0.00001 does output "0.0XYZ1" (this
bug appears only with the ZX81/TS1000 BIOS, it's fixed in the TS1500, Lambda
8300, and Spectrum BIOSes).<br>
<br>
<b>NEW</b><br>
Restarts BASIC. The program, all variables, and all further memory up to
RAMTOP are erased. In the ZX80 this is equivalent to CALL 0.<br>
<br>
<b>NEXT b</b><br>
Adjusts b as specified in the corresponding FOR command, and (if the target
condition has not been reached or exceeded) loops back to the line following
to the FOR command. The ZX does not understand "NEXT" as alias for "NEXT b".<br>
<br>
<b>ON ERR command (Timex TS2068/TC2068 only)</b><br>
Defines error handling. command can be combined GOTO, CONT, or RESET.<br>
<br>
<b>OUT n,m (Spectrum only)</b><br>
Writes a byte (m) to the specified 16bit I/O address (n).<br>
<br>
<b>PAUSE n (ZX81/Spectrum only)</b><br>
Pauses the program for n/50 seconds (assuming 50Hz display refresh rate)
or until the user hits a key, and displays the screen for the duration
of this period (even if display was disabled by FAST mode). The highest
allowed value for n is 32767. Note that hitting the BREAK key (SPACE) stops
the program rather than continuing it. On the Spectrum, PAUSE 0 waits endless
(until a key is pressed).<br>
<br>
<b>PLAY string1[,string2[,string3]] (Spectrum 128/+2/+2A/+3 only)</b><br>
Plays up to three sounds (on the three PSG sound channels). The strings are
composed of following characters:<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  c-b  Play note within current octave     (c,d,e,f,g,a,b)
  C-B  Play note within next higher octave (C,D,E,F,G,A,B)
  $    Flattens note following it (can be more flattened by $$ or $$$ etc.)
  #    Sharpens note following it (can be more sharpened by ## or ### etc.)
  &amp;    Play silence (a pause of same length as normal c-b and C-B notes)
  _    Tied notes (eg. "5_7c" = crotchet c and a minim c tied together)
  On   Set current octave (0..8)
  Tn   Set tempo (60..240)
  n    Set length of notes (1..12) (use "Nn" if preceeded by other digits)
  Nn   Separates two numbers (eg. octave=1,length=2 --&gt; O1N2, instead of O12)
  Vn   Set volume level (0..15) (0=Off, 15=Loudest)
  Wn   Set volume envelope type (0..7) (bit0=ATTACK, bit1=HOLD, bit2=REPEAT)
  Xn   Set volume envelope frequency (0..65535) (affects all 3 channels)
  U    Turn on volume envelope in any string
  (    Set loop start (if none specified: default is begin of string)
  )    Jump to loop start (repeat 2x, multiple brackets can repeat 4x,8x,16x..)
  ))   Jump to loop starts (repeats endless if only ONE loop start was defined)
  ! !  Enclose a comment
  H    Stop PLAY command (stops all 3 channels, including endless looping ones)
  Mn   Configure PSG channels (bit0..2=Tone A..C, bit3..5=Noise A..C)
  Yn   Turn on MIDI channel (1..16)
  Zn   Send MIDI programming/configuration code (numbers depend on hardware)
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>Although the sounds are hardware generated, the program gets paused until the
PLAY command has finished, which is making the feature rather useless.<br>
<br>
<b>PLOT x,y (ZX81/Spectrum only)</b><br>
ZX81: Draws a black dot (of 4x4 pixels, ie. one quarter of a 8x8 pixel
character) at the specified position by using graphics characters. Spectrum:
Draws a single pixel. For both ZX81/Spectrum: The origin (0,0) is at the
lower left of the screen, excluding the bottom-most two character lines.<br>
<br>
<b>POKE m,n</b><br>
Writes the byte n at address m into memory, both must be decimal values (the
ZX does not recognize hexadecimal numbers).<br>
<br>
<b>PRINT ...</b><br>
Displays the operand(s) - if any - on the screen. Possible operands are:<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  a) nothing
  b) a numeric expression, displayed either as
       normal decimal number (if in range 10^-5 .. 10^13)
       otherwise as nnEmm indicating nn*10^mm
     leading zeroes are displayed only if the first digit after
     the "." is not zero, ie. 0.3 and .03 are displayed as such.
  c) a string. undefined characters are displayed as question marks.
  d) AT y,x; - moves the PRINT position to the specified screen
     location, 0,0 is upper left.
  e) TAB n; - moves the PRINT position to the specified horizontal
     location. If this is to the left of the current location, then
     the vertical position is incremented.
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>Operands may be separate by semicolon ";" (next operand displayed directly at
current position) or comma "," (next operand displayed at next TAB 0 or TAB
16 position).<br>
Upon completion, the print position is moved to the begin of the next
line (unless expression was terminated by semicolon or comma).<br>
An error may be generated if memory or screen is full, if so, CONT may
be used to clear the screen and to continue the program.<br>
<br>
<b>RAND [n] (called RANDOMISE on ZX80, and RANDOMIZE on Spectrum)</b><br>
Initializes the random generators seed (n=1..65535). When n is zero (the
default), the current frame counter is used as seed.<br>
<br>
<b>READ v1[,v2[,v3]] (Spectrum only)</b><br>
Loads expressions from DATA lines into the specified variable(s). See also:
RESTORE.<br>
<br>
<b>REM ...</b><br>
Defines a remark, ignored by the program. The comment field may be also
mis-used to define binary machine code inside of a basic program.<br>
However, the comment may not contain a NEWLINE character (76h) - ie. a
HALT instruction (opcode 76h) may not be used, as well as any other
opcodes with 76h as parameter byte, such like JP 4176h, or LD A,76h,
etc.<br>
<br>
<b>RESET (Timex TS2068/TC2068 only)</b><br>
Intended to reset connected peripherals. No idea if/which/how any peripherals
do actually support this command.<br>
<br>
<b>RESTORE [n] (Spectrum only)</b><br>
Sets the first line number where following READ commands start searching for
DATA statements, the default is the begin of the program.<br>
<br>
<b>RETURN</b><br>
Returns to the line following to the most recently executed GOSUB command.<br>
<br>
<b>RUN [n]</b><br>
Clears all variables and jumps to the specified line number. The default is
the first line of the program. See GOTO for details.<br>
<br>
<b>SAVE f</b><br>
Saves the system area, the program, the video memory, and any defined
variables to cassette. The filename f must be a 1-127 characters string,
which may not include inverted characters. The text display is suspended for
the duration of saving, white lines are displayed indicating the cassette
signals.<br>
When using SAVE from inside of the program, then the program is automatically
continued at the following line. Note that the GOSUB stack is not saved, so
that SAVE should not be used from inside of a sub-routine.<br>
The ZX80 does not support filenames, just enter SAVE without parameter.<br>
<br>
<b>SCROLL (ZX81 only)</b><br>
Moves the display upwards, and inserts a blank line at the bottom.<br>
Note: The blank line is totally empty, in VRAM it is defined as a single HALT
opcode, without any SPACE characters.<br>
<br>
<b>SLOW (ZX81 only)</b><br>
Switches to SLOW mode (approx. 4 times slower than FAST mode). The text
screen is displayed, and the program is executed during vertical blanking
periods only. The ZX81 is initially operating in SLOW mode.<br>
The ZX80 does not support SLOW and FAST commands, and it is always operating
in FAST mode.<br>
<br>
<b>SOUND index,data [;index,data] [...] [;index,data] (Timex TS2068/TC2068 only)</b><br>
Allows to write one or more values to the PSG sound registers. Unlike the
PLAY/BEEP commands, it does just start (or stop or change) sounds, but
doesn't pause program execution.<br>
<br>
<b>SPECTRUM (Spectrum 128/+2/+2A/+3 only)</b><br>
Switches to Spectrum 48K backwards-compatible mode. Disables the new I/O
ports, disables the Extended System area, re-enables the old color codes like
{INK RED}, re-enables the hotkey mode like R=RUN, etc. The BASIC program (if
any) is kept in memory (eg. allows to load 48K program from Spectrum +3 disk
drive, and then run it in 48K mode).<br>
<br>
<b>STOP</b><br>
Stops the program. User may enter CONT to continue in following line.<br>
<br>
<b>UNPLOT x,y (ZX81 only)</b><br>
Same as PLOT, but drawing a white dot instead of a black dot.<br>
<br>
Additional commands...<br>
<br>
<b>FORMAT (Spectrum only)</b><br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>       FORMAT LINE baudrate    ;default=9600
       FORMAT LPRINT target    ;"R"=RS232, "C"=Centronics
       FORMAT LPRINT tokenmode ;"E"=Expanded, "U"=Unexpanded tokens

Note that all ZX81 and Spectrum 48K functions must be entered in form of
SHIFT or FUNCTION mode key combinations. For example, type SHIFT+ENTER,B for
the INKEY$ keyword - attempting to enter I,N,K,E,Y,$ would result in a syntax
error. The same applies for multi-character operands such like "&gt;=" and "**".<br>
For the ZX80 and Spectrum 128/+2/+2A/+3 it is vice-versa, and all functions
must be entered character by character. Also, ZX80 function parameters must
be put into () brackets.<br>

2).<br>
<br>
<b>STR$ n</b><br>
Returns n converted into a string.<br>

<br>
<b>USR n</b><br>
Calls a machine program in memory at address n, and returns the value of
the BC register when (if) the machine code program returns. The ZX does
not recognize hexadecimal addresses.<br>

inverted characters, C0h-FFh and 40h-42h for keywords, 7Eh for values, and
76h indicates the end of the line. On the Spectrum, characters are in ASCII,
keywords are different, values are 0Eh, and end of line is 0Dh.<br>
Values are duplicated in program lines: First, as normal text, ie. as
entered by the user (this field is ignored during execution, still it
must exist, but might be always set to "0" if desired). And second, invented
by the code 7Eh, as pre-calculated 5-byte FLOAT number.<br>
An immediate thus occupies at least 7 bytes. However, there are some grindy
methods to save memory, such like: PI-PI defines 0 in only 3 bytes, VAL "9"
defines 9 in only 4 bytes, etc.<br>

MSB is Bit 14 (ie. 4000h) the exponent byte must be set to 14+81h
(=8Fh). The sign bit is zero (Bit 7 of first byte), and the remaining
bits, in this case Bit 13-0 (3FFFh), are shifted to the left as much as
possible (so that highest bit is located in Bit 6 of first byte) the
four bytes must be: 7F FE 00 00.<br>

and, in some further cases (not sure when?) that causes problems.<br>
<br>
<b>5-byte FLOAT bug</b><br>
There's some inaccuracy when converting text strings (eg. user input) to
float numbers. For example, the correct value for 0.25 would be 7F 00 00 00
00, however, the ZX81/TS1000 BIOSes do convert it to 7E 7F FF FF FF
(accidently rounded down), the TS1500 BIOS does unsuccessfully try to fix
that problem by converting it to 7F 00 00 00 01 (accidently rounded up). This
is resulting in incompatibility, for example,<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  10 FOR I = 0 TO 1 STEP .25
  20 PRINT I
  30 NEXT I
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>The ZX81/TS1000 does correctly stop at 1 being displayed as last number,
whilst the "improved" TS1500 does incorrectly stop at 0.75. Mind that
immediates are pre-compiled at time of entering the program code, so a
program SAVEd on a ZX81, may work exactly as on the ZX81 even when LOADing it
on a TS1500 (unless it contains conversions being done at runtime, like VAL
".25" or VAL A$).<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  1 IF VAL"0.25" &lt; 1/4 THEN PRINT "TOO SMALL (ZX81 OR TS1000 OR SPECTRUM)"
  2 IF VAL"0.25" &gt; 1/4 THEN PRINT "TOO BIG (TS1500 OR LAMBDA)"
  3 IF VAL"0.25" = 1/4 THEN PRINT "MATCH (WHOOPS)"
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>Typing IF VAL"0.25" forces conversion on runtime (typing IF 0.25 would be
converted when entering the program, and stay so even when SAVing it and
LOADing it on another computer). Interestingly, the TOO SMALL variants, do
also (incorrectly) display a MATCH in line 3.<br>
